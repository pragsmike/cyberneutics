# CJT-Style Run: Independent Votes (No Cross-Reading)

**Question:** Should we add a Code of Conduct (CoC) to the repository? Aye or Nay.

Each character was prompted in isolation: same question and context, no access to other characters' responses. Votes and rationales below.

---

## Maya

**Vote:** Nay

**Rationale:** CoCs are political instruments. Who enforces it? Who decides what counts as a violation? I've seen them used to shut down disagreement, not just to curb abuse. The repo is methodology and docs; we don't have a large community or moderation apparatus. Adding a CoC without a clear enforcement path is either theater or a weapon waiting for a target. If we're optimizing for inclusivity we could say so in the README without adopting a formal CoC. Nay until we have a transparent process for who interprets and enforces.

## Frankie

**Vote:** Aye

**Rationale:** The project makes claims about rigor and intellectual honesty. We should state what kind of space we want: respectful disagreement, no harassment, no discrimination. A minimal CoC — e.g. Contributor Covenant or a short custom one — signals that we care about who can contribute and how they're treated. Not having one can read as "we didn't think about it" or "we're okay with anything." Principle: if we want a certain kind of community, we name it. Aye for a minimal, clear CoC.

## Joe

**Vote:** Nay

**Rationale:** I've seen CoCs backfire. Projects adopt one, then a dispute happens and the CoC gets invoked selectively — one side gets warned, the other doesn't. The repo is small; we don't have a moderation team. A CoC without capacity to enforce fairly is worse than none: it creates the appearance of fairness while allowing inconsistent application. Let's not add one until we have either a clear enforcement process or evidence that our community size and type actually need it. Nay for now.

## Vic

**Vote:** Aye

**Rationale:** The evidence on whether CoCs improve contributor diversity or reduce bad behavior is mixed, but the cost of adding a standard one is low. Many contributors and funders expect to see a CoC; its absence can be a signal we're not serious about inclusion. I'm not claiming a CoC will fix anything — I'm saying the downside of not having one (perception, friction for some contributors) outweighs the downside of having a minimal one. Aye for a standard, short CoC; we can revisit if enforcement becomes an issue.

## Tammy

**Vote:** Aye

**Rationale:** A CoC is a system intervention: it sets expectations before conflict happens. Without it, the first time someone feels wronged we're making up the rules on the spot. Having a short, clear CoC reduces ambiguity and gives everyone the same reference. The feedback loop is: stated norms → fewer surprises → less escalation. I'm not arguing for heavy enforcement — I'm arguing for stating the norms. Aye for a minimal CoC that we can point to when needed.
