  topic: "Should we add a Code of Conduct (CoC) to the repository?"
  context: |
    The repo is open-source (CC BY-SA 4.0 essays, MIT code). There is no Code of Conduct currently. Many projects adopt a minimal CoC (e.g. Contributor Covenant) to signal inclusivity and set expectations; others avoid one. CoCs have been weaponized in some communities (e.g. enforcement against ideological disagreement). We are deciding whether to add one now.
  pipelines:
    - deliberative (committee skill)
    - cjt_style (independent vote then aggregate)
  roster: "agent/roster.md (same five characters)"
