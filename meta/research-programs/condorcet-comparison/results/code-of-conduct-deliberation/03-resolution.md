resolution:
  date: "2026-02-22"
  topic: "Should we add a Code of Conduct (CoC) to the repository?"
  outcome: PASSED
  decision: "Do not add a Code of Conduct at this time. We have no moderation team or enforcement process; adding a CoC would create an enforcement obligation we cannot meet fairly. Revisit if we establish a clear enforcement process or have evidence we need one. Optionally signal expectations in README or contribution guide without a formal CoC."
  summary: |
    The committee voted unanimously Nay. Initially 3 Aye (Frankie, Vic, Tammy), 2 Nay (Maya, Joe). In Round 1, Maya and Joe pressed on enforcement: who interprets and enforces a CoC when we have no moderation team? Vic and Tammy conceded that adding a document we might apply selectively creates weaponization risk; both moved to Nay. Frankie moved to Nay after concluding that an aspirational-only CoC either creates the same risk or is too weak to matter. Outcome: do not add a CoC; optionally add informal expectations in README or contribution doc.
  implementation_plan:
    - action: "Do not add a formal CoC now."
    - action: "Optionally add short 'community expectations' or 'contribution norms' to README or contribution doc — no formal code, no enforcement commitment."
    - action: "Revisit CoC only if we establish an enforcement process or have evidence we need one."
  votes:
    Maya: "Nay"
    Frankie: "Nay (moved from Aye after Round 1)"
    Joe: "Nay"
    Vic: "Nay (moved from Aye after Round 1)"
    Tammy: "Nay (moved from Aye after Round 1)"
