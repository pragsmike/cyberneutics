- **Primary plan (Societies of Thought):** [meta/research-programs/societies-of-thought-research-plan.md](research-programs/societies-of-thought-research-plan.md) — ten action items, four phases, success criteria
- **Other active programs:** [evaluation-schemes](research-programs/evaluation-schemes.md), [ablation-study](research-programs/ablation-study.md), [multi-model-committee](research-programs/multi-model-committee.md)
