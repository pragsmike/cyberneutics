# Meta: Reflective Documentation

This directory contains documentation *about* the methodology's
evolution, adoption, and self-assessment — distinct from the
methodology itself (essays/, artifacts/) and from operational
session state (agent/).

| Audience | Directory |
|---|---|
| **Community, future committees, contributors** | `meta/` (this directory) |
| **Successor agents, session continuity** | `agent/` (handoffs, diaries, deliberation records) |
| **Practitioners learning the methodology** | `artifacts/` (techniques, templates, guides) |
| **Theorists understanding the foundations** | `essays/` (theoretical framework) |
| **Formalists specifying pipelines** | `palgebra/` (the algebra) |

## Contents

### [methodology-evolution.md](methodology-evolution.md)

How the methodology developed: mistakes made, dead ends explored,
patterns that emerged, and a chronological development trajectory
from January 29, 2026 through the present. Includes maturity
assessment and open questions.

### [uptake-and-usage.md](uptake-and-usage.md)

External adoption signals: forks, platform integrations, practitioner
feedback, and what they tell us about whether the methodology works
outside its birthplace. Tracks against the predictions made by the
Feb 1, 2026 self-evaluation.

## Why This Directory Exists

The methodology claims to be self-improving: applying Cyberneutics to
itself should produce measurable improvements. This directory is where
that claim gets tested.

- **methodology-evolution.md** shows whether the methodology actually
  evolved through practice (not just accumulated documentation)
- **uptake-and-usage.md** shows whether anyone outside the project
  finds it useful (the external validation gap)

Future `/committee` deliberations about project direction should read
this directory first to understand the project's current state and
what external signals say about where to invest effort.
