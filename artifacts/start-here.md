# Start Here: 15-Minute Onboarding

A curated path through existing materials for a practitioner who wants to understand and use the Cyberneutics methodology. Total time: about 15 minutes.

## The Gist (2 min)

LLMs are **narrative engines**, not calculators. Treating them like search or logic leads to shallow or subtly wrong outputs. This methodology gives you rigorous, traceable techniques for **decisions under genuine uncertainty** — explore possible futures, evaluate them adversarially, repeat to map the decision landscape, trace every commitment to the arguments that produced it.

Do these in order. Skim if needed; links open the full essays.

1. **[Why Narrative Engines Change Everything](../essays/01-why-narrative-engines-change-everything.md)** (~4 min)  
   The paradigm shift: numeric → symbolic → narrative computing. Why new methodology is necessary.

2. **[From Practice to Theory](../essays/02-from-practice-to-theory.md)** (~3 min)  
   How the techniques emerged from operational failure — adversarial committees, Robert's Rules, independent evaluation — and why they work.

3. **[Introduction to Sense-Making](../essays/03-sensemaking-101.md)** (~3 min)  
   Dervin's situation–gap–bridge model. Why sense-making is active construction, not information retrieval.

- **Quick path**: [Quick Start Guide](quick-start-guide.md) — your first committee deliberation in about 30 minutes (setup + one run).
- **Concept path**: [Adversarial Committees](adversarial-committees.md) — the core technique: fixed character roster, structured debate, resolution with provenance.

## What Next?

- **More theory**: [Essays README](../essays/README.md) — reading paths for Practitioners, Theorists, Skeptics, and Formalists.
- **Full pipeline**: Scenario generation (explore futures) → committee (evaluate) → resolution. See [Deliberated Choice Workflow](deliberated-choice-workflow.md) and the [full-pipeline worked example](examples/full-pipeline-worked-example.md).
- **When it fails**: [When This Methodology Fails](../essays/when-methodology-fails.md) — failure modes, scope boundaries, and when not to use the full pipeline.
