# Example Transcripts

This directory will contain a collection of annotated deliberation transcripts to demonstrate the methodology in action.

## Planned Contents

*   **High-scoring deliberations**: Examples of what "good" looks like.
*   **Low-scoring deliberations**: Examples of common failure patterns.
*   **Before/after iterations**: Demonstrations of how lessons learned improve quality.
