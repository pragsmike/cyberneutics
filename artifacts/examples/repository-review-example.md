# Example: Repository Self-Review Using Cyber-Sense

**Scenario**: Evaluating whether the Cyber-Sense repository documentation is ready for external practitioners.

**Challenge**: The repository creator (mg) has deep context about the methodology's development. How do we assess "readiness" without creator blindness?

**Solution**: Apply Cyber-Sense methodology to itself—convene an adversarial committee to review the repository.

---

## The Setup

**Motion Presented**: "The Cyber-Sense repository as currently constituted is ready for external practitioners to discover, understand, and apply the methodology effectively."

**Committee Roster**: Standard five-character committee
- **Maya**: Data/evidence analyst - quantifies readiness metrics
- **Frankie**: Optimist/accessibility advocate - practitioner experience
- **Joe**: Institutional memory - historical context, development trajectory
- **Vic**: Skeptic - citation rigor, evidence demands
- **Tammy**: Values/ethics - accessibility vs gatekeeping tension

**Process**: Full parliamentary procedure per Robert's Rules

## Key Findings

### Consistency Issues (Maya)

- **Contradiction**: README claims "early-stage documentation" while handoff notes say "V1.0 readiness"
- **Quantified gap**: Only 1 worked example vs. minimum 3 needed to establish methodology validity
- **Metric proposed**: Repository is ~25% ready for broad practitioners

### Accessibility Problems (Frankie)

- **Cognitive load**: 7,500 words (Essay 01 + Adversarial Committees) before user does anything
- **Entry point buried**: Quick Start Guide exists but not prominently featured in README
- **15-minute test failure**: Cannot discover, understand, and succeed in 15 minutes

### Evidence Gaps (Vic)

- **Citation inconsistency**: Essay 01 (entry point) references Dervin and Second-Order Cybernetics without citations
- **Unfalsifiable claims**: "More rigorous analysis" compared to what baseline?
- **Insufficient examples**: One hiring decision is anecdote, not validation

### Hidden Value (Joe)

- **Handoff insights**: Valuable lessons about methodology evolution buried in `/copilot/` directory
- **Learning trajectory**: Real mistakes and dead ends documented but not visible to users
- **Institutional memory**: Development story could build trust if surfaced

### Values Tension (Tammy)

- **Audience ambiguity**: Targets both "frustrated practitioners" and "theorists" but optimizes for neither
- **Language accessibility**: Academic terminology (hermeneutics, Deleuzian philosophy) gates practitioner access
- **Mission clarity**: Is this FOR practitioners or ABOUT a methodology?

## Amendments Proposed and Passed

All five amendments passed unanimously (5-0):

### Amendment 1: Clarify Maturity Statement
**Before**: "Early-stage documentation of emerging methodology"
**After**: "Techniques refined through practice, reached stable equilibrium. Documentation suitable for early adopters and researchers. Broader practitioner readiness requires additional worked examples and external validation."

**Rationale**: Honest about what's validated (techniques) vs. what's needed (broader documentation)

### Amendment 2: Restructure Getting Started
**Change**: Make Quick Start Guide the FIRST link, not buried under theory options
**Rationale**: Meet practitioners where they are—doing before reading

### Amendment 3: Add Evidence Base Statement
**Addition**: New README section documenting:
- What evidence exists (author's use, one worked example)
- What evidence is needed (external validation, multiple domains, failure cases)
- Invitation to contribute results

**Rationale**: Transparency builds trust, invites collaboration

### Amendment 4: Create References Document
**Addition**: `/references/key-sources.md` with annotated bibliography
**Rationale**: Address citation gaps without disrupting essay flow

### Amendment 5: Surface Development Insights
**Addition**: `/meta/methodology-evolution.md` extracting key lessons from handoffs
**Rationale**: Show living methodology, not static doctrine. Handoff insights valuable externally.

## Independent Evaluation Results

*Deliberation passed to separate evaluator for RUBRIC scoring*

| Rubric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Reasoning Chain Completeness | 3/3 | Full problem→cause→solution chains maintained |
| Evidence Quality | 2/3 | Strong quantification, but some intuitive claims ungrounded |
| Alternative Explanations | 2/3 | Multiple framings, but didn't explore all possibilities |
| Trade-off Recognition | 3/3 | Accessibility vs rigor central to amendments |
| Uncertainty Acknowledgment | 3/3 | Explicit uncertainty flagging throughout |

**Overall: 13/15 (87%)** - High-quality deliberation

## Lessons Extracted

### Documentation-Creator Blindness
**Pattern**: Creator has deep context, assumes others share it. Results in inconsistent messaging.
**Solution**: External review by someone without context. Adversarial committee with "fresh eyes" character (Frankie).

### Single-Example Generalization Risk
**Pattern**: One example feels like proof to creator, reads as anecdote to skeptics.
**Solution**: Minimum N≥3 examples across domains, plus at least one failure case.

### Theory-First vs Practice-First Tension
**Pattern**: Structure follows creator's mental model (theory→practice) rather than user needs (practice→theory).
**Solution**: Dual pathways clearly signposted. "Try it in X minutes" BEFORE "understand philosophy."

### Internal Documentation Holds External Value
**Pattern**: Handoffs, development logs show methodology evolution—valuable externally, not just internally.
**Solution**: Create `/meta/` directory making development insights public.

## Outcome

**Final Vote**: Amended motion passed 5-0

**Status Change**: Repository moved from "ready for practitioners" to more accurate "ready for early adopters and researchers with five amendments implemented."

**Implementation Priority**:
1. Critical (do first): Amendments 1-3 - messaging, structure, evidence (65 minutes total)
2. High priority: Amendments 4-5 + 2 more examples (6-8 hours)
3. Medium priority: Failure cases, troubleshooting expansion (conditional on user feedback)

**Measurable Impact**: Amendments move repository from ~25% ready to ~70% ready for early adopters.

## Meta-Insight

This review itself demonstrates the methodology's value:
- **Without committee**: Creator might claim "ready" based on effort invested
- **With committee**: Specific gaps identified, quantified, addressed
- **Result**: Honest assessment, actionable improvements, appropriate expectations

The repository improved BY being evaluated with its own tools. That's the strongest validation possible.

## For Practitioners

**What you can learn from this example**:

1. **Apply methodology to itself**: If it can't evaluate its own quality, it's not rigorous
2. **Quantify readiness**: "~25% ready" is more useful than "not ready" or "ready"
3. **Unanimous votes signal quality**: When all five characters agree, amendments are well-justified
4. **Evidence gaps are findable**: Vic's citation audit, Maya's example count are systematic
5. **Meta-recursion works**: Evaluating evaluation doesn't infinite-loop—it stabilizes at actionable improvements

**Common mistakes avoided**:
- Creator didn't defend the repository—committee deliberated independently
- Amendments were specific and measurable, not vague ("add more examples")
- Evaluation included rubric scoring to check deliberation quality itself
- Lessons extracted for future application (not just this repo)

**Time investment**: ~20 minutes to generate full deliberation, evaluation, and recommendations. Compare to: weeks of user feedback, confused practitioners, reputation damage from over-promising.

That's the methodology's core value: rigorous analysis faster than trial-and-error.
