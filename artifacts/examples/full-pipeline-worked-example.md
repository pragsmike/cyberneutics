# Full-Pipeline Worked Example: Methodology Adoption Strategy

This document is the **full-pipeline worked example** called for in the methodology-adoption-strategy resolution: end-to-end scenarios → committee → resolution, with honest commentary on what the process surfaced.

The run is the same one that produced that resolution — the committee deliberated *about* adoption strategy and, in doing so, recommended (among other things) creating a worked example. This deliberation record is that example. The provenance chain is fully traceable.

## The Situation

**Topic**: Cyberneutics methodology adoption strategy over the next 12 months.

**Uncertainties**: Whether depth or breadth drives adoption; whether early adopters (Condorcet researcher, MOOLLM, Residuality Theory) are leading indicators or anomalies; whether theoretical density is barrier or attractor; whether outreach or organic discovery yields more durable adoption.

**Stakes**: Whether the project stays a personal knowledge base, becomes a practitioner tool, or grows into a community methodology.

**Evidence at the time**: Three adoption signals (two forks, one platform integration), no sustained external usage data.

## The Scenarios (Fan)

Four scenarios were generated, spanning depth-vs-breadth and growth-vs-stagnation:

1. **The Scholarly Archive** (Continuity): Current trajectory continues; polished but isolated.
2. **The Accidental Standard** (Disruption): High-profile promotion; demand outstrips docs; brand diluted by simplified reimplementations.
3. **The Condorcet Bridge** (Opportunity): Contributor formalizes jury-theorem link; academic citation hook; small rigorous community.
4. **The Attention Drought** (Constraint): mg time drops ~50%; early adopters dormant; space feels commoditized.

Each scenario had narrative, implications, and early-warning signs. None was dismissed as implausible.

## The Committee Deliberation (Funnel)

The committee received the scenario set and was charged with: given these futures, what should the project do? Success criteria included engaging with at least two scenarios per member, and producing both robust actions (good across scenarios) and scenario-dependent actions with triggers.

**Notable moves during deliberation**:

- **Maya** framed the “political” question: who is the project for? Argued that mg’s behavior (depth-first, no outreach) already revealed a preference for something like The Scholarly Archive; the committee’s job was to make that choice visible.
- **Frankie** argued that a full-pipeline worked example was the single most valuable accessibility deliverable — not simplifying theory, but *showing* the pipeline in action.
- **Vic** insisted the worked example be empirically honest: a case where the process actually changed the outcome, not marketing.
- **Joe** pointed out that *this* deliberation was exactly that — scenario-aware committee on a real strategic question — and could serve as the worked example if the output was good enough.
- **Tammy** mapped feedback loops (depth→barrier→isolation, breadth→dilution→loss, formalization→citation→credibility) and argued for actions that strengthen positive loops and weaken negative ones across scenarios.

The resolution format that emerged — robust vs. scenario-dependent actions, monitoring plan, explicit “no dismissed futures” — was shaped by the scenario context. The committee engaged with concrete futures, not abstract strategy options.

## The Resolution

**Decision**: Pursue a resilience strategy: four robust actions by Q2 2026, scenario-dependent contingency plans with explicit triggers, and monthly/quarterly monitoring.

**Robust actions**: (1) Start Here reading path, (2) full-pipeline worked example, (3) when-methodology-fails.md, (4) monitoring infrastructure (GitHub analytics, citation alerts, quarterly uptake review).

**Scenario-dependent actions**: Condorcet contributor shares draft → prioritize bridging essay and references, support actively; traffic spike → deploy Start Here, newcomer issue template, resist core simplification; mg time &lt;5h/week for 2+ months → pause essays, maintain skills, support contributors.

**Key assumption flagged**: The resolution assumes the project wants external adoption. If The Scholarly Archive (polished excellence without reach) is the desired outcome, the robust actions are unnecessary. That’s an editorial choice for the user.

## Honest Commentary: What the Process Surfaced

1. **Scenario context changed the deliberation.** Without the four scenarios, the committee would likely have debated “depth vs. breadth” in the abstract. With them, members argued in terms of specific futures (e.g. “If Accidental Standard happens we’re unprepared”; “Condorcet Bridge is the historical best-case but depends on a contributor”). The output was therefore scenario-aware: robust actions that work across futures, plus triggered contingencies.

2. **The “worked example” recommendation was self-applying.** The committee recommended a full-pipeline worked example; this run *is* that example. That created a double stake: the resolution had to be both a good strategy and a good demonstration. The format (robust vs. scenario-dependent, monitoring, no dismissed futures) is structurally different from a typical committee-only resolution.

3. **A key assumption was made explicit.** Several members (especially Maya) raised that mg might actually prefer The Scholarly Archive. The resolution doesn’t resolve that; it states the assumption and leaves the choice to the user. That’s the methodology working as intended — surfacing the load-bearing assumption rather than burying it.

4. **Evidence was scarce and that was acknowledged.** Vic stressed sample size of 3; the resolution notes “no dismissed futures” partly because evidence was insufficient to rule any scenario out. The monitoring plan is there to improve that over time.

5. **Would the outcome have been different without the pipeline?** Without scenarios, the committee might have converged on a vaguer “depth + some accessibility” stance. Without the requirement to engage multiple scenarios, scenario-dependent triggers might not have been specified. The process produced a *resilience* strategy (adequate across futures) rather than a bet on one future — and that distinction came from the fan→funnel composition.

**Summary**: This run is the full-pipeline worked example. The records live under `agent/scenarios/methodology-adoption-strategy/` and `agent/deliberations/methodology-adoption-strategy/`. The resolution is in [03-resolution.md](../../agent/deliberations/methodology-adoption-strategy/03-resolution.md). The limitations document (when-methodology-fails.md) and Start Here path are separate deliverables from the same robust-action set.
