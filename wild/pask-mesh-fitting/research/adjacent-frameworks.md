# 2.6 Adjacent Frameworks

**Relational Message Passing (RelGNN, 2025)**: Composite message passing that respects relation types during graph neural network learning. Directly applicable to learning typed embeddings of both corpus mesh and fragments.

**Hypergraph Neural Networks**: The typed hypergraph representation of Pask meshes is naturally handled by hypergraph neural networks. Petri Graph Neural Networks (PGNN, 2025) support multimodal flow and nested relations. The emerging Hypergraph Interchange Format (HIF) provides a standard for cross-tool compatibility.

**Ologs (Ontology Logs)**: A category-theoretic approach to knowledge representation where every olog is a category, objects are concept types, and morphisms are relations. Commutative diagrams enforce consistency constraints. Functors between ologs enable data migration and schema integration. Connects directly to the palgebra formalism and to sheaf theory.
