Nanni's Neo‑Cybernetics Manifesto is a long, evolving text, so I'll give a concise, structured summary of its main content rather than reproducing it.

## Overall framing

The manifesto opens by arguing that we live in a world defined by complexity, interdependence, and escalating crises (conflict, inequality, ecological and technological risks), and that a **holistic discipline** is needed to navigate and shape such a world.  Neo‑Cybernetics is proposed as that discipline: a paradigm for understanding the "intricacies and flows of systems, whether natural, technological, or sociocultural."

It explicitly says it is a **foundational guide and beacon** for the movement, but stresses that, in cybernetic fashion, it is not fixed; it should evolve through feedback from both the internal community and the wider world.  The text invites engagement, critique, and collaboration, presenting Neo‑Cybernetics as a collective, adaptive project. [academia](https://www.academia.edu/106335517/Neo_Cybernetics_Manifesto)

## Purpose and objectives

The manifesto sets out Neo‑Cybernetics as:

- A discipline for analyzing and shaping systems across domains (ecological, social, technological) via concepts like feedback, regulation, emergence, and reflexivity. [neo-cybernetics](https://www.neo-cybernetics.org)
- A response to the **metacrisis** (climate change, global risks, technological disruption), i.e., a way to think and act across silos rather than treating each crisis in isolation. [neo-cybernetics](https://www.neo-cybernetics.org)
- A framework that integrates **ethics** into systems thinking, emphasising that decisions should serve human and ecological well‑being rather than short‑term gain. [neo-cybernetics](https://www.neo-cybernetics.org)

It positions Neo‑Cybernetics as bridging existing traditions: systems thinking, ecology, design, and futures studies, seeking patterns that support fairness and resilience at societal scale. [neo-cybernetics](https://www.neo-cybernetics.org)

## Core concepts and cybernetic heritage

A substantial portion of the manifesto situates Neo‑Cybernetics in the history and theory of cybernetics. It emphasizes:

- Classic cybernetic structures: **regulation**, **self‑organization**, and **reflexivity**, presented as generic structures that can describe "any systemic problem." [academia](https://www.academia.edu/106335517/Neo_Cybernetics_Manifesto)
- A "third approach" to philosophy of science: beyond normative (how knowledge *should* be) and sociological (how knowledge *is* produced), cybernetics adds a **biological approach**, focusing on living systems and their adaptive dynamics. [academia](https://www.academia.edu/106335517/Neo_Cybernetics_Manifesto)
- The ethical implications of this biological approach: because it centers living systems and their viability, ethics is not an afterthought but structurally built into how we think about interventions. [academia](https://www.academia.edu/106335517/Neo_Cybernetics_Manifesto)

The manifesto repeatedly notes that early cybernetics was an optimistic, interdisciplinary attempt to understand adaptation and self‑regulation in machines, organisms, and societies, and argues that the 21st‑century metacrisis is precisely the kind of situation cybernetics was meant to address.

## Neo‑Cybernetics as contemporary cybernetics

The text draws heavily on contemporary work that re‑reads or extends cybernetics for today. It cites:

- The Kybernetes special issue **"Cybernetic frameworks for a shared world"**, which emphasizes regulation, self‑organization, reflexivity, and ethics, and frames cybernetics as a way to deal with current and future challenges for humankind. [academia](https://www.academia.edu/68848595/Guest_editorial_Cybernetic_frameworks_for_a_shared_world?hb-g-sw=20465100)
- The anthology **"Cybernetics for the 21st Century Vol. 1"**, focused on epistemological reconstruction of cybernetics and its role in technology, ecology, and planetary politics. [academia](https://www.academia.edu/106335517/Neo_Cybernetics_Manifesto)

Using these, Nanni positions Neo‑Cybernetics as:

- A continuation of cybernetics into new domains (AI, planetary politics, digital infrastructures) rather than a break with it. [academia](https://www.academia.edu/106335517/Neo_Cybernetics_Manifesto)
- A move away from narrow, object‑oriented understandings of systems toward seeing the world as infrastructure and interrelated systems. [academia](https://www.academia.edu/106335517/Neo_Cybernetics_Manifesto)
- A focus on interaction, listening, learning, and conversation with internal and external perturbations, rather than just control in the narrow sense. [academia](https://www.academia.edu/106335517/Neo_Cybernetics_Manifesto)

## Epistemology and philosophy of technology

The manifesto connects Neo‑Cybernetics to contemporary philosophy of technology and media theory. It references, among others, Brunella Antomarini, Slava Gerovitch, Katherine Hayles, Yuk Hui, Andrew Pickering, Dorion Sagan, and others, via the 21st‑century cybernetics literature. [academia](https://www.academia.edu/106335517/Neo_Cybernetics_Manifesto)

Key epistemic points:

- Cybernetics sees beings as **heterogeneous assemblages** constituted through information flows and feedback, not as static objects. [academia](https://www.academia.edu/106335517/Neo_Cybernetics_Manifesto)
- The ontology is **relational, recursive, and reflexive**: entities are defined by their interactions, performances, and homeostatic dynamics. [academia](https://www.academia.edu/106335517/Neo_Cybernetics_Manifesto)
- Cybernetics offers a way to understand how histories and realities are constructed over time, including the "cybernetics of the concept of history" itself. [academia](https://www.academia.edu/106335517/Neo_Cybernetics_Manifesto)

These ideas ground the manifesto's claim that Neo‑Cybernetics can help us see how our choices ripple through infrastructures and systems, and how narratives and institutions co‑produce the "reality" we act in. [neo-cybernetics](https://www.neo-cybernetics.org)

## Ethics, governance, and practice

Ethics and governance are presented as intrinsic, not optional:

- Because cybernetics deals with **homeostasis, adaptation, and viability** of living and social systems, questions of what should be maintained or transformed are inescapably ethical. [academia](https://www.academia.edu/106335517/Neo_Cybernetics_Manifesto)
- Neo‑Cybernetics aims to **equip a new generation of practitioners** (across companies, governments, NGOs, communities) with systems thinking skills so that they can design interventions that support long‑term human and ecological flourishing. [neo-cybernetics](https://www.neo-cybernetics.org)

The manifesto stresses:

- The importance of **plural perspectives** and cross‑disciplinary dialogue, since no single discipline can grasp complex systemic problems. [neo-cybernetics](https://www.neo-cybernetics.org)
- The need to move from purely analytical models to **experimental and applied work** that acknowledges the full scope of problems and tests practical, sustainable approaches. [neo-cybernetics](https://www.neo-cybernetics.org)
- A view of cybernetics as the "art of interacting, listening, learning and conversing" with perturbations, rather than a top‑down control ideology. [academia](https://www.academia.edu/106335517/Neo_Cybernetics_Manifesto)

## Living document and invitation

Finally, the manifesto repeatedly underlines that:

- It is a **living document** that should evolve as the community learns and as feedback is incorporated. [academia](https://www.academia.edu/106335517/Neo_Cybernetics_Manifesto)
- Neo‑Cybernetics is meant to be built by "many minds and voices from multiple disciplines, backgrounds and industries," and the manifesto explicitly invites critique and collaboration. [academia](https://www.academia.edu/106335517/Neo_Cybernetics_Manifesto)

On the website, this is operationalized as links to:

- The **Medium publication** for essays and case studies.  
- The **GitHub repositories** for theoretical models and operational frameworks.  
- The manifesto itself as "the foundational document outlining the core principles, objectives, and vision of the Neo‑Cybernetics movement." [neo-cybernetics](https://www.neo-cybernetics.org)
