# Neo-cybernetics and cyberneutics: meta-level relations

This document compares the **Neo-Cybernetics initiative** and **cyberneutics** as initiatives—projects that apply cybernetic ideas to 21st-century technology and social change. For content-level comparison of the ideas, see [content-level-relations.md](content-level-relations.md).

## Same family of move

**Revival/application of cybernetics for 21st-century conditions.** Neo-cybernetics does this explicitly: metacrisis, AI, digital infrastructure, planetary politics. Cyberneutics does it implicitly by asking how to regulate and design systems that include a new kind of adaptive, narrative-producing component (LLMs) so that human sense-making and decision remain viable.

**Self-application.** Both treat their own process as cybernetic. Neo-cybernetics: living manifesto, evolution through community feedback. Cyberneutics: handoffs, gap analysis, methodology evolution, meta documents that track how the method changes. In both, "how we run this project" is consistent with the philosophy.

**Breadth vs. depth.** Neo-cybernetics is a broad-tent movement (many domains, many disciplines, "many minds and voices"). Cyberneutics is a narrow, deep methodology (one repo, one primary curator, specific artifacts and algebra). Same family—"apply cybernetics to 21st-century tech and social change"—but Neo-Cybernetics is the umbrella and cyberneutics is a focused branch that answers "how, in practice, do we do sense-making and decision under uncertainty when the system includes LLMs?"

## Summary

At the meta level they are **sibling initiatives**: same impulse to apply cybernetic ideas to contemporary technology and social change, with Neo-cybernetics as the broad programme and cyberneutics as a disciplined, local instance focused on LLM-augmented sense-making and decision under uncertainty. Cyberneutics could be written up as a case study or application note within the Neo-Cybernetics framing.
