## Goals of the initiative

Neo-Cybernetics presents itself as an open, interdisciplinary **third-wave cybernetics** movement and community (not a single lab or company). Its stated purposes include:

- **Revive cybernetics** as a contemporary, rigorous discipline for 21st-century problems: metacrisis, climate, global risks, technological disruption.
- **Study and model** "driving forces and flows of systems"—natural, technological, and sociocultural—with emphasis on interconnectedness and emergence.
- **Bridge silos**: facilitate communication between scientific and professional domains (systems thinking, ecology, design, futures, etc.).
- **Design resilient, learning systems** aligned with human and ecological well-being, with ethics as a central concern rather than an add-on.

The GitHub README frames it as a **discipline** with conceptual frameworks, guides and methodologies, case studies, and curated literature. The manifesto describes it as a holistic discipline for analyzing and shaping systems via feedback, regulation, emergence, and reflexivity, and as a response to the metacrisis that integrates ethics into systems thinking.

## History of the initiative

- The initiative is described as a **loose community** of people brought together by shared interest in cybernetics, systems thinking, complexity, and futures studies—not a formal company or university center.
- **Daniele Nanni** is identified as founder and editor (volunteer role); he is based in Oxford, UK, and works in product/innovation, data analytics, and systems design. The manifesto and core framing texts are associated with him.
- The **Neo-Cybernetics Manifesto** is the foundational document; it is explicitly a living document intended to evolve through feedback from the community and the wider world.
- The project draws on contemporary cybernetics literature (e.g. the Kybernetes special issue "Cybernetic frameworks for a shared world," the "Cybernetics for the 21st Century" anthology) and positions itself as a continuation of cybernetics into new domains (AI, planetary politics, digital infrastructures) rather than a break with it.
- Public materials do not provide a detailed institutional or founding timeline; the emphasis is on an evolving, community-driven movement with Medium, GitHub, and the website as primary public faces.
- The initiative **encourages federation**: the [Neo-Cybernetics Federation](https://www.neo-cybernetics.org/federation) aims to attract communities, corporations, research institutions, and thought leaders into a network of shared knowledge, innovation, and purpose. The Federation is described as a network of companies, organizations, and communities united by shared dedication to neo-cybernetics principles. Benefits offered to members include shared R&D, a unified vision (contributing to principles and methodologies), knowledge exchange (dialogues, workshops, symposiums), and amplified impact (policy, education, industry). The site includes a "Federation Members & Partners" section and an invitation to join via a [contact form](https://forms.gle/YiY4c4EZfNXME5yk7).
