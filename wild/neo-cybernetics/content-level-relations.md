# Neo-cybernetics and cyberneutics: content-level relations

This document compares the *ideas* of the Neo-Cybernetics initiative (as summarized in this directory) with cyberneutics. For meta-level comparison (the two as initiatives), see [meta-level-relations.md](meta-level-relations.md).

## Shared cybernetic core

**Feedback and reflexivity.** Neo-cybernetics emphasizes regulation, self-organization, reflexivity, and "interacting, listening, learning and conversing" with perturbations rather than top-down control. Cyberneutics builds feedback into the methodology (committees, evaluation, handoffs, provenance) and treats "observation changes state" as central—every response modifies the user's cognitive state. Both treat the system as changed by its own operation.

**Resistance to single-answer collapse.** Neo-cybernetics stresses plural perspectives and cross-disciplinary dialogue; cyberneutics explicitly warns against collapsing to one answer and uses adversarial committees, scenarios, and probes to keep multiple perspectives in play. Both treat "one polished answer" as a failure mode.

**Ethics in the loop.** Neo-cybernetics builds ethics in via viability, adaptation, and flourishing of living and social systems. Cyberneutics builds in norms via provenance, graded confidence, and the user as editor who decides what "gets published to reality." In both, normative questions are structural, not afterthoughts.

**Relational, process-oriented ontology.** Neo-cybernetics describes "heterogeneous assemblages" and "relational, recursive, reflexive" entities constituted by information flows and interactions. Cyberneutics' decorated texts (text + metadata), pipelines, and propagation rules (confidence, provenance) instantiate that: artifacts and processes defined by relations and transformations rather than fixed objects.

## Distinct emphasis

**Scope.** Neo-cybernetics aims at systems in general (ecological, technological, sociocultural, metacrisis). Cyberneutics is narrowly scoped: systems that include **LLMs as sense-making partners** and the problem of **decision under uncertainty** in that setting.

**"Repetition produces difference."** In cyberneutics, running the same prompt multiple times maps the latent space of interpretations—exploration rather than convergence. That is a recognizably cybernetic move (exploring the dynamics of a system rather than seeking a single equilibrium), but operationalized in a specific way around narrative computing and prompt–response dynamics.

## Summary

At the content level, **cyberneutics can be read as one applied neo-cybernetic project**: it takes feedback, reflexivity, redundancy, plural perspectives, and explicit epistemology and applies them to the particular system "human + LLM(s) in sense-making and decision under uncertainty."
