# Gordon Pask's Conversation Theory

Conversation Theory is Pask’s formal account of learning as a **conversation** between cognitive systems (people and/or machines) that seek to reach and test shared understandings of a topic. [en.wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_theory)

## Core idea

- Learning happens through recursive conversations where participants alternate roles of “teacher” and “learner” and try to reach mutual understanding of some subject matter. [learn.akkadium](https://learn.akkadium.com/gordon-pask-conversation-theory/)
- A “conversation” can be human–human or human–machine; what matters is that both sides can express, test, and revise their understandings. [stream.syscoi](https://stream.syscoi.com/2019/10/23/conversation-theory-gordon-pask-instructionaldesign-org/)

## Teachback and mutual understanding

- The critical method is **teachback**: I show I’ve learned something by teaching it back to you in my own terms. [stream.syscoi](https://stream.syscoi.com/2019/10/23/conversation-theory-gordon-pask-instructionaldesign-org/)
- A conversation counts as successful when each participant can correctly describe the other’s understanding of a topic and this understanding persists during the interaction (Pask’s CET heuristic). [en.wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_theory)

## Languages and levels

- Conversations operate at multiple language levels:  
  - Natural language (everyday talk),  
  - Object languages (formal/technical language about the subject),  
  - Metalanguages (talk about learning and about the language itself). [communicationtheory](https://www.communicationtheory.org/conversation-theory/)
- The same idea can be “re‑voiced” across these levels to stabilize a shared concept. [en.wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_theory)

## Concepts and entailment structures

- For Pask, a concept is defined by how topic relations support and entail one another within a domain; each topic relation \(R_i\) is produced and maintained via other relations in a cyclic way. [en.wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_theory)
- He represents subject matter as **entailment structures** (or meshes): graphs of topics showing prerequisite, subordinate, superordinate, and analogical relations—maps of how ideas hang together. [pangaro](https://www.pangaro.com/history-conversation-theory.html)

  - Serialist learners tend to move step‑by‑step through these structures; holist learners jump around, seeking big‑picture relations; versatile learners can do both. [learn.akkadium](https://learn.akkadium.com/gordon-pask-conversation-theory/)

## Formal architecture of a conversation

Pask’s “conversational architecture” includes: [communicationtheory](https://www.communicationtheory.org/conversation-theory/)

- Topic relations: the concepts that can be talked about.  
- Speech acts/descriptions: the utterances (or other expressions) used to talk about them.  
- Procedural repertoires: the available actions that modulate the conversation (asking, explaining, questioning, testing, demonstrating).  
- A modelling facility: the shared space where participants build and manipulate models of the topic (diagrams, code, simulations, musical structures, etc.).

These together form a “conversational skeleton,” the minimal structure needed for learning conversations. [communicationtheory](https://www.communicationtheory.org/conversation-theory/)

## Cybernetic framing

- Conversation Theory is explicitly cybernetic: it treats learning as a controlled dynamic process in which systems act, sense the consequences, and adjust—in this case via linguistic or symbolic interaction. [stream.syscoi](https://stream.syscoi.com/2019/10/23/conversation-theory-gordon-pask-instructionaldesign-org/)
- Pask saw this as a framework that could be implemented in adaptive teaching machines and interactive systems, making him an early figure in AI‑based educational technology. [elearningindustry](https://elearningindustry.com/applying-conversation-theory-instructional-design)


# Conversation theory in cyberneutics

You can treat all three as describing how a person moves through a problem‑space: Pask gives the **micro‑mechanics** of learning conversations, Deleuze gives the **geometry** of the space (rhizome/walk), and Dervin gives the **phenomenology** of gaps and crossings. [en.wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_theory)

## 1. Shared frame: movement in a conceptual space

- Pask: A learner builds an entailment mesh of topics and relations; learning is a conversational process that grows and stabilizes this mesh. [pangaro](https://www.pangaro.com/history-conversation-theory.html)
- Deleuze: A rhizome is a non‑hierarchical map where any point can connect to any other; a “walk” is a line of flight—an experimental path through this mesh‑like multiplicity. [thoughtleader.co](https://thoughtleader.co.za/what-is-a-rhizome-in-deleuze-and-guattaris-thinking/)
- Dervin: Sense‑Making starts from a **situation**, a felt **gap**, and a **bridge** the person constructs to move forward; information is material for building that bridge. [epicpeople](https://www.epicpeople.org/sensemaking-methodology/)

Integrated: the learner walks a rhizomatic space, encountering gaps, and uses conversation to construct bridges that extend and rewire their entailment mesh.

## 2. Pask + Deleuze: entailment meshes as rhizomes

- Pask’s entailment mesh is already rhizomatic: concepts are cyclically mutually entailing topic relations, not a tree of prerequisites. [en.wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_theory)
- Deleuze/Guattari’s rhizome emphasizes multiple entry points, non‑hierarchy, and maps oriented toward experimentation rather than tracing a fixed structure. [thenandnow](https://www.thenandnow.co/2023/05/21/the-rhizome-a-thousand-plateaus-deleuze-and-guattari/)

So:
- Take an entailment mesh and refuse to privilege a root; let any concept be an entry.  
- A “walk” is a sequence of conversational moves through the mesh, including jumps, analogies, and “lines of flight” that leave the current subgraph and land in another. [thoughtleader.co](https://thoughtleader.co.za/what-is-a-rhizome-in-deleuze-and-guattaris-thinking/)

Design implication: in a system, don’t force linear prerequisite paths; allow lateral jumps and encourage users to surface surprising links (Deleuzian walk) while the system tracks and updates the underlying entailment mesh (Pask).

## 3. Pask + Dervin: conversations as gap‑bridging

- Dervin: people act when they perceive a **gap**; methods ask them what questions they had, what they needed to learn, and how they bridged their situation. [sciencedirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030645739390020E)
- Pask: a conversation continues until participants can successfully *teach back* each other’s understanding and maintain it over time; the mesh encodes the structure they’ve co‑constructed. [philpapers](https://philpapers.org/archive/MANWIC-2.pdf)

Integrated:
- Each conversational move can be seen as: articulate a gap → propose a bridge → test it via teachback.  
- The entailment mesh is a historical record of gaps that have been bridged and how; each new gap may require revising the mesh (learning as ongoing sense‑making). [keileggers](https://keileggers.com/2021/03/30/sense-making-methodology-reader/)

Design implication: build interactions where the system explicitly elicits the user’s gaps (Dervin), proposes or co‑constructs candidate bridges, and then asks for teachback or re‑description (Pask).

## 4. Deleuze + Dervin: walks, gaps, and lines of flight

- Deleuze’s rhizome: a map for experimental movement on a plane of immanence; no final “view from above,” only local traversals and recompositions. [en.wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome_(philosophy))
- Dervin: sense‑making is situated, time‑bound, and oriented to local action; people construct their own maps and bridges rather than receiving a universal one. [en.wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensemaking_(information_science))

Integrated:
- A Deleuzian walk is the embodied sequence of sense‑making moves: each gap encountered can spawn a line of flight, leading to a new region of the rhizome.  
- There is no authoritative path; each person’s history of gaps and bridges is a singular trajectory through a shared but non‑totalizable space.

Design implication: let users leave “traces” of their walks (their questions, bridges, detours), and treat these as first‑class data rather than noise.

## 5. All three together: an integrated schema

You can sketch a unified model like this:

1. **Space**: A rhizomatic conceptual field (Deleuze) that is *represented* for a given learner as an evolving entailment mesh (Pask). [pangaro](https://www.pangaro.com/history-conversation-theory.html)
2. **Agent**: A situated sense‑maker who encounters situations, experiences gaps, and seeks or constructs bridges (Dervin). [epicpeople](https://www.epicpeople.org/sensemaking-methodology/)
3. **Process**:  
   - The agent walks the rhizome (choosing paths, making jumps).  
   - At each gap, they enter into conversations (with others or a system) to construct bridges.  
   - Through teachback and mutual testing, some bridges stabilize and become edges in the entailment mesh.  
   - The mesh in turn shapes future walks (affordances, expectations, attractors).  

This gives you a cybernetic loop:
- Walk → gap → conversation → bridge → mesh update → changed future walks.

## 6. Concrete design patterns (for tools / practices)

Translating this into something you could build or practice:

- **Rhizomatic interface over an entailment mesh**:  
  - Under the hood, maintain Paskian topic/entailment structures.  
  - On the surface, present them as a map with multiple entry points and no root, inviting Deleuzian wandering (search from any node, jump via analogy). [en.wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_theory)

- **Gap‑first dialogue**:  
  - Start interactions by asking users what confuses them, what they’re trying to do—Dervin’s gap questions. [keileggers](https://keileggers.com/2021/03/30/sense-making-methodology-reader/)
  - Log gaps as first‑class objects; link them to nodes in the mesh.

- **Teachback loops**:  
  - After explaining or suggesting a move, ask the user to restate it in their own terms or to act it out (e.g., modify code, alter a patch). [stream.syscoi](https://stream.syscoi.com/2019/10/23/conversation-theory-gordon-pask-instructionaldesign-org/)
  - Use this to refine the entailment mesh and detect where understanding is still misaligned.

- **Support multiple walk styles**:  
  - For “serialist” trajectories, offer guided sequences; for “holist,” allow rapid jumps, overviews, and cross‑domain analogies. [learn.akkadium](https://learn.akkadium.com/gordon-pask-conversation-theory/)
  - The system should adapt to the observed walk style, in Pask’s sense.

- **Archive walks as shared rhizomes**:  
  - Store user trajectories (sequence of nodes, gaps, bridges, teachbacks) and make them remixable, like shared paths through the rhizome.  
  - Over time, this collective archive approximates a Deleuzian map: open, connectable, constantly modifiable. [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/1bfp7t/deleuze_and_guattaris_rhizome_concept_can_someone/)


# Conversation theory, teachback, and residuality

You can read Pask’s teachback and O’Reilly’s residuality as describing the same pattern at different scales: **what counts as “knowledge” is what’s still standing after repeated perturbation.** [en.wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_theory)

## 1. Pask: teachback as micro‑residuality

- In Conversation Theory, understanding is whatever structure still holds after you and I have tried to break it via questioning and **teachback**. [lisahalverson](https://lisahalverson.com/2011/02/22/gordon-pasks-conversation-theory/)
- A concept is defined as a cyclically maintained network of topic relations; if that entailment mesh survives reformulation, application to new situations, and mutual explanation, it counts as “known.” [instructionaldesign](https://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/conversation-theory/)
- So each conversational move—challenge, rephrasing, application—is a “shock”; what remains invariant across those shocks is the residual structure of understanding.

## 2. O’Reilly: residuality as macro‑teachback

- Residuality Theory in software architecture stresses systems by imagined disasters and records the **residues**—design elements that survive and mitigate many stressors. [ericnormand.substack](https://ericnormand.substack.com/p/residuality-theory)
- You iteratively apply shocks (stressors) to a naive architecture, observe failures, and add mitigations; the accumulated mitigations form a residual architecture that can handle unseen shocks. [architecture-weekly](https://www.architecture-weekly.com/p/residuality-theory-a-rebellious-take)
- That’s a large‑scale analogue of teachback: each disaster scenario is the environment “asking” the system to demonstrate its understanding; residues are what persists across those interrogations.

## 3. Common structure: shocks → residuals

Put side by side:

- Pask:  
  - Shocks = questions, rephrasings, applications to novel contexts, role‑reversals in teaching. [communicationtheory](https://www.communicationtheory.org/conversation-theory/)
  - Residuals = entailment structures and conversational agreements that remain stable and re‑producible.  
- O’Reilly:  
  - Shocks = random or systematic stressors against an architecture. [gotopia](https://gotopia.tech/episodes/369/residues-and-the-architects-paradox)
  - Residuals = design patterns, constraints, and structures that continue to work across many stressors. [ericnormand.substack](https://ericnormand.substack.com/p/residuality-theory)

In both, **knowledge is not initial design/description; it is the residue of failed attempts to break it.** The “curriculum” (Pask) or “architecture” (O’Reilly) is gradually carved out by the pattern of things that refused to die.

## 4. Design consequence

- At the micro level, you don’t just store answers; you store what has survived a sequence of conversational shocks—contradictions, counter‑examples, attempts at teachback.  
- At the macro level, you don’t just design an ML/audio system once; you keep a record of what parts of your workflow or architecture keep working after you throw weird edge‑cases, adversarial sessions, or chaotic live situations at them.

That’s a neat unification: **a Paskian “understanding” is just a residual architecture of concepts; an O’Reilly “residue” is a Paskian understanding scaled to systems engineering.**
