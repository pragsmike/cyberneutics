Heinz von Foerster (1911–2002) was an Austrian‑American scientist who worked at the intersection of physics, biology, philosophy, and what became known as second‑order cybernetics. He is widely regarded as one of the key figures in cybernetics and systems theory, especially for shifting attention from observing systems to observing the observer of systems.

## Brief biography

- Born in Vienna in 1911, he was connected with the Viennese intellectual milieu influenced by the Vienna Circle and Ludwig Wittgenstein, to whom he was related. [houseofethics](https://www.houseofethics.lu/2021/05/26/back-to-future-1-heinz-von-foerster-1911-2002/)
- After World War II he emigrated to the United States in 1949, initially invited by Warren McCulloch, and later became a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana‑Champaign. [distributedmuseum.illinois](https://distributedmuseum.illinois.edu/exhibit/heinz_von_foerster/)
- He founded and directed the Biological Computer Laboratory (BCL) at Illinois (1958–1975), which became a hub for early cybernetics, cognition research, and experimental computing. [europeanfamilytherapy](https://europeanfamilytherapy.eu/heinz-von-foerster/)
- He died in 2002 at the age of 90. [latimes](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-nov-13-me-passings13.1-story.html)

## Main contributions

- **Second‑order cybernetics:** Von Foerster helped articulate the idea that the observer must be included within the system being described, leading to a “cybernetics of cybernetics” that considers how our descriptions are themselves part of the system. [en.wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_von_Foerster)
- **Biological Computer Laboratory:** At BCL he supported work at the crossroads of electronics, biophysics, cognition, and computation, including early experiments in parallel computing and models of perception and learning. [informationphilosopher](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/scientists/foerster/)
- **Population “Doomsday equation”:** In a 1960 Science article, he and co‑authors fit a simple hyperbolic model to historical world‑population data, which mathematically implied a divergence (an “infinite population”) on November 13, 2026, his 115th birthday. It was intended more as a provocative extrapolation than a literal prediction. [latimes](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-nov-13-me-passings13.1-story.html)
- **Memory and cognition:** His early work proposed a physical and mathematical model of memory, treating memory loss as an exponential decay phenomenon related to macromolecular processes. This fed into broader work on cognition and knowledge from a systems perspective. [informationphilosopher](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/scientists/foerster/)

## Philosophy, ethics, and constructivism

- Von Foerster is associated with radical constructivism, emphasizing that observers actively construct reality rather than passively mirror an objective world. He captured this stance with the slogan “It is like I tell it,” in contrast to “Tell it like it is.” [houseofethics](https://www.houseofethics.lu/2021/05/26/back-to-future-1-heinz-von-foerster-1911-2002/)
- His **ethical imperative** is often summarized as: “Act always so as to increase the number of choices,” suggesting that ethical action is about expanding possibilities rather than narrowing them. [houseofethics](https://www.houseofethics.lu/2021/05/26/back-to-future-1-heinz-von-foerster-1911-2002/)
- Influenced by Wittgenstein, he held that ethics is primarily something to be enacted, not fully expressible in propositions—“ethics cannot be articulated, ethics must be acted.” [houseofethics](https://www.houseofethics.lu/2021/05/26/back-to-future-1-heinz-von-foerster-1911-2002/)

## Personality and side interests

- Colleagues often describe him as a playful polymath with a strong sense of humor and a love of **magic**, which he practiced since childhood and used as a metaphor for perception and reality. [uiaa](https://uiaa.org/2020/08/06/ingenious-the-magician-of-bcl/)
- He was known for highly interdisciplinary gatherings and teaching, bringing together engineers, philosophers, artists, and social scientists in a shared systems‑oriented conversation. [distributedmuseum.illinois](https://distributedmuseum.illinois.edu/exhibit/heinz_von_foerster/)


Heinz von Foerster participated in the later Macy Conferences on cybernetics (the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation meetings on “Circular Causal and Feedback Mechanisms in Biological and Social Systems”) as a younger physicist/engineer who became part of the core cybernetics “thought collective.” His role was not as an organizer (that was Warren McCulloch as chair, with Frank Fremont‑Smith at the foundation), but as an increasingly central interlocutor whose later work came to epitomize some of the conferences’ themes. [en.wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences)

## When and how he was involved

- Von Foerster joined after the earliest (1946–47) meetings, entering once the group had already coalesced around feedback, homeostasis, and information as key notions. [archives.library.illinois](https://archives.library.illinois.edu/the-cybernetics-thought-collective-a-history-of-science-and-technology-portal-project/the-cybernetics-thought-collective/)
- He contributed as a physicist and biophysicist interested in circular causality in neural and physiological systems, aligning with discussions on feedback and self‑regulating mechanisms. [hostb](https://hostb.org/5Z8/Pias,%20Claus%20ed.%20-%20Cybernetics%20The%20Macy%20Conferences%201946-1953%20I%202003.pdf)
- In later recollections (e.g., in the edited transcripts by Claus Pias), he describes being invited by McCulloch, presenting his own theory and realizing that concepts like feedback and circular causality were the “seeds” for a physiological theory of mentation. [hostb](https://hostb.org/5Z8/Pias,%20Claus%20ed.%20-%20Cybernetics%20The%20Macy%20Conferences%201946-1953%20I%202003.pdf)

## Intellectual role and influence

- Within the Macy milieu he helped push questions of feedback toward issues of cognition and epistemology, anticipating what he would later call second‑order cybernetics (including the observer in the system). [archives.library.illinois](https://archives.library.illinois.edu/the-cybernetics-thought-collective-a-history-of-science-and-technology-portal-project/the-cybernetics-thought-collective/)
- His interventions sit alongside those of Wiener, McCulloch, Bateson, Mead, Ashby, Shannon, and von Neumann in shaping cybernetics as a cross‑disciplinary language for behavior, information, and control. [emcsr](https://emcsr.net/looking-back-in-history-the-macy-conferences/)
- The conferences provided him with the network and conceptual toolkit (feedback, closure, circular causality) that he later developed into his mature positions on constructivism and the role of the observer. [archives.library.illinois](https://archives.library.illinois.edu/the-cybernetics-thought-collective-a-history-of-science-and-technology-portal-project/the-cybernetics-thought-collective/)

## Status in the Macy group

- Contemporary and retrospective accounts list Heinz von Foerster among the principal scientific participants—often described as a biophysicist and “architect of cybernetics”—even though he was not one of the original conveners. [emcsr](https://emcsr.net/looking-back-in-history-the-macy-conferences/)
- The published Macy transcripts (e.g., in Pias’s “Cybernetics. The Macy Conferences 1946–1953”) preserve his contributions as part of the core discussions rather than as peripheral commentary, indicating he was treated as a full member of the inner circle.
