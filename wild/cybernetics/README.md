# wild/cybernetics — Pask, von Foerster, and narrative thinking

Material on Gordon Pask, Heinz von Foerster, and conversation theory. We keep it here to learn **what Pask can add to our picture of narrative thinking and computing**.

Conversation theory offers a way to think about human–machine communication that is done in **natural language**, rather than the stilted not-even-pidgin languages we had before. It is closer to a conversation between people—except that only the **person** truly has "understanding." What passes for "understanding" in the LLM, or in the engineered system composed from them, is nothing like it. Pask’s framework (teachback, entailment meshes, conversational architecture) still gives a vocabulary and a target: we can ask how far a given system approximates the structure of a learning conversation, and where it necessarily falls short.

Pask speaks of the **"art of defensible metaphors."** Category theory is the science of defensible metaphors. The link is worth holding in view when we formalize pipelines and artifacts.

**Intake convention:** Content here is not yet settled methodology. See the documents below for provenance and citations before drawing on this material.

## Relation to the rest of the repo

- **Conversation theory ↔ cyberneutics:** The Pask–Deleuze–Dervin integration in conversation-theory.md (walk, gap, bridge, mesh) gives a vocabulary for sense-making that fits LLM-augmented dialogue; teachback and residuality align with committees, evaluation, and revision as repeated perturbations to see what holds.
- **Residuality:** The teachback–residuality link is developed in [conversation-theory.md](conversation-theory.md); related material is in [wild/residuality-theory](../residuality-theory/).
