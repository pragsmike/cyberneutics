# How did von Foerster assemble and maintain a community around the ideas of cybernetics?

He brought people together primarily through in‑person networks, seminars, and residencies centered on the Biological Computer Laboratory (BCL) at Illinois; “virtual” coordination in the modern sense didn’t exist yet, though he used letters, publications, and conference proceedings to extend the network. [distributedmuseum.illinois](https://distributedmuseum.illinois.edu/exhibit/biological_computer_laboratory/)

## In‑person hub: the BCL

- The BCL (founded 1958) functioned as an interdisciplinary lab and salon, attracting visitors from all over the world—anthropologists like Margaret Mead, biologists like Humberto Maturana, engineers, artists, and others. [archives.library.illinois](https://archives.library.illinois.edu/2016/12/06/heinz-von-foerster-and-the-bcl/)
- People typically came physically to Urbana‑Champaign for visits, sabbaticals, and extended stays; accounts describe BCL as an international center of cybernetics and a “nerve center” of the movement. [uiaa](https://uiaa.org/2020/08/06/ingenious-the-magician-of-bcl/)
- He also returned after retirement for residencies with students at Allen Hall, continuing the in‑person conversational culture. [distributedmuseum.illinois](https://distributedmuseum.illinois.edu/exhibit/heinz_von_foerster/)

## How he found and recruited people

- He entered the Macy Conferences circle, volunteered to edit their proceedings, and thus embedded himself in a high‑level interdisciplinary network (Wiener, McCulloch, Mead, Bateson, von Neumann, Ashby, Shannon, etc.). [ethw](https://ethw.org/Heinz_von_Foerster)
- From this circle he invited key figures to Urbana: visitors included W. Ross Ashby (who joined the Illinois faculty), Gordon Pask, Jerry Lettvin, and others who became regulars at BCL. [cepa](https://cepa.info/fulltexts/2758.pdf)
- His published work on memory, self‑organizing systems, and cybernetics, plus his reputation as a “magician” and “mischiefologist,” made BCL a magnet; many came because they had read or heard of the lab’s experiments and conversations. [bclillinois.vercel](https://bclillinois.vercel.app)

## Modes of persuasion

- Personal charm and hospitality were crucial: contemporaries describe his **embodied** conversational style, humor, and use of magic tricks as central to how he drew people into long, exploratory discussions. [billseaman](https://billseaman.com/Papers/Towards%20A%20Dynamic%20Heterarchical%20Ecology%20Of%20Conversations_Final_2%20copy.pdf)
- He framed BCL as a place where disciplinary boundaries were deliberately loosened—an environment suited to people dissatisfied with narrow, reductionist research agendas. [distributedmuseum.illinois](https://distributedmuseum.illinois.edu/exhibit/biological_computer_laboratory/)
- He offered concrete opportunities: visiting positions, collaboration on experiments (e.g., parallel computing devices, models of perception), and participation in BCL’s prolific publication series. [ethw](https://ethw.org/Heinz_von_Foerster)

## Communication beyond the lab (pre‑internet “virtuality”)

- He extended the network via edited proceedings of the Macy conferences and BCL reports, which circulated internationally and connected scattered researchers who shared cybernetic concerns. [distributedmuseum.illinois](https://distributedmuseum.illinois.edu/exhibit/biological_computer_laboratory/)
- Extensive correspondence (preserved in his Illinois archives) shows him cultivating relationships through letters, arranging visits and conferences, and maintaining an ongoing distributed conversation in print and mail rather than online.

# How could this be done today?

Here’s a concrete “playbook” for a modern ML‑era BCL inspired by how von Foerster actually operated. [constructivist](https://constructivist.info/7/3/196.clarke.pdf)

## 1. Define the in‑person hub

- Create a physical anchor: a studio, lab, or regular venue where people know “this is where the weird, cross‑disciplinary stuff happens.” [archives.library.illinois](https://archives.library.illinois.edu/2016/12/06/heinz-von-foerster-and-the-bcl/)
- Host small, informal gatherings more than formal courses—BCL was notorious for few structured classes and many open conversations, demos, and ad‑hoc sessions. [constructivist](https://constructivist.info/7/3/196.clarke.pdf)
- Make the room itself signal permeability: whiteboards, audio gear, screens, score paper, dev machines, and coffee all in one space so people can cross tools and languages easily. [distributedmuseum.illinois](https://distributedmuseum.illinois.edu/exhibit/biological_computer_laboratory/)

## 2. Curate who you invite (and why)

- Start from existing high‑leverage circles (your “Macy conferences”): ML folks, audio nerds, systems theorists, compositional weirdos, HCI people.  
- Look for people who are dissatisfied with single‑discipline answers and hungry for new metaphors—this is exactly who BCL attracted (Maturana, Pask, Ashby, etc.). [biologyofcognition.wordpress](https://biologyofcognition.wordpress.com/about/)
- When you invite someone, frame it as: “Come teach us X, and we’ll expose you to Y,” mirroring how von Foerster negotiated with hematologists and others: they teach domain data, he brings modeling and formalism. [informationphilosopher](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/scientists/foerster/interview.html)

## 3. Structure the conversations, not (just) the research

- Run recurring “heterarchical” sessions: no fixed hierarchy, rotating presenters, and emphasis on questions over results. [billseaman](https://billseaman.com/Papers/Towards%20A%20Dynamic%20Heterarchical%20Ecology%20Of%20Conversations_Final_2%20copy.pdf)
- A typical pattern:  
  - 20–30 min demo or talk (e.g., “autopoiesis and live coding,” “family systems, RL, and mixing a record”),  
  - 60–90 min open conversation with explicit permission to wander and cross‑connect domains.  
- Keep a visible artifact of each session (shared notes, patches, code snippets, stems, diagrams), as BCL did via its publication series and reports. [archives.library.illinois](https://archives.library.illinois.edu/2016/12/06/heinz-von-foerster-and-the-bcl/)

## 4. Make a modern “BCL publication series”

- Start a GitHub org or simple static site that acts like the BCL reports: numbered “technical reports” that can be anything from essays to Jupyter notebooks to stems plus commentary. [distributedmuseum.illinois](https://distributedmuseum.illinois.edu/exhibit/biological_computer_laboratory/)
- Each visiting collaborator (even if “visiting” means a series of Zooms) produces at least one artifact under that imprint.  
- Treat these as invitations: every report ends with “If this resonates, contact X for collaboration,” replicating the way BCL reports and Macy proceedings pulled new people in. [ethw](https://ethw.org/Heinz_von_Foerster)

## 5. Use today’s “virtual Macy/BCL”

- Run a regular online seminar with a stable name and topic (e.g., “Cybernetics of Sound and Learning”), similar to ongoing seminar series in other fields that combine theory and application. [broadinstitute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/scientists/technical-workshops)
- Archive talks with slides, code, and recordings so the seminar becomes a searchable knowledge base and recruiting tool, not just an event stream. [broadinstitute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/scientists/technical-workshops)
- Rotate time zones and formats (short talks, long dialogues, live coding sets, critique sessions) to keep it conversational rather than a one‑way webinar.

## 6. How to persuade people (von Foerster style)

- Lead with curiosity: “I don’t understand your field, but I suspect our tools could help each other—would you be willing to come teach us?” mirrors exactly how he approached other domains. [informationphilosopher](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/scientists/foerster/interview.html)
- Offer a playground, not a contract: emphasize that the space is for experiments, half‑baked ideas, and hybrids that wouldn’t get funded in normal venues—this is how BCL positioned itself relative to mainstream departments. [constructivist](https://constructivist.info/7/3/196.clarke.pdf)
- Use hospitality as infrastructure: schedule long meals, walks, and jams around sessions; many BCL interactions were remembered as extended, informal conversations rather than formal collaborations. [distributedmuseum.illinois](https://distributedmuseum.illinois.edu/exhibit/heinz_von_foerster/)

## 7. Design for ongoing orbits, not one‑off visits

- For key visitors (your Ashbys or Maturanas), aim for recurring residencies: a week every year, a standing remote slot every month, or a shared project that spans visits. [emerald](https://www.emerald.com/k/article-split/33/9-10/1365/262487/Second-order-cybernetics-an-historical)
- Build a “core ensemble” of 5–10 people who show up regularly and know each other’s languages; visitors plug into that ensemble rather than starting from zero.  
- Use a low‑friction channel (Discord/Matrix/Slack) as the always‑on conversation layer, analogous to the constant correspondence preserved in von Foerster’s archives. [archives.library.illinois](https://archives.library.illinois.edu/2016/12/06/heinz-von-foerster-and-the-bcl/)

## 8. Minimal patterns you could adopt immediately

For you specifically (audio + ML + systems):

- Declare a topic container: “Cybernetics of Audio Practice” or similar, and use that label consistently in invitations and artifacts.  
- Start a monthly hybrid salon in your studio with 1 remote guest each time; record, lightly edit, and publish as a numbered “BCL‑style” series with stems, patches, and notes.  
- Maintain a public repo that lists: participants, sessions, artifacts, open questions, and “wanted collaborators,” turning your scene into a visible, joinable network.
