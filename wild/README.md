This is where ideas come in to be tamed.
They may be further developed, but don't count on it.

## Known Limitations

- **[Blast Radius Problem](blast-radius-problem/)**: Exploring role-differentiation in an agent committee as a load-bearing architectural requirement for tasks with asymmetric failure modes (e.g., declarative fleet management).
- **[Cyberneutics Director](cyberneutics-director/)**: A conceptual deliberative routing architecture for multi-agent workflows, differentiating between task coordination and decision deliberation.
- **[Palgebra Graph Visualization](palgebra-graph-ui/)**: UX and UI concepts for visualizing computational structure (using blackbody heat encoding) rather than just task state (Kanban).
- **[Pask Mesh Fitting](pask-mesh-fitting/)**: Currently assessed as computationally intractable at scale ($O(N^3)$ complexity) due to reliance on topological matrix math and massive LLM extraction volume. See its [Tractability and Risks](pask-mesh-fitting/research/tractability-and-risks.md) document for details.
