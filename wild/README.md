This is where ideas come in to be tamed.
They may be further developed, but don't count on it.

## Known Limitations

- **[Pask Mesh Fitting](pask-mesh-fitting/)**: Currently assessed as computationally intractable at scale ($O(N^3)$ complexity) due to reliance on topological matrix math and massive LLM extraction volume. See its [Tractability and Risks](pask-mesh-fitting/research/tractability-and-risks.md) document for details.
