# Session Handoff: 2026-02-16

## Session Summary

**Duration**: Extended session — repo review, structural integration, skill enrichment, documentation
**Main Accomplishments**:
- **Integrated palgebra into README**: Added palgebra as a third pillar in "What's in this repository?" with a connecting paragraph explaining the why/how/what-precisely relationship between essays, artifacts, and palgebra. Added to the "Want the theory?" getting-started path.
- **Reviewed and enriched the `/committee` skill**: Compared the skill against the 860-line character-propensity-reference, adversarial-committees.md, and committee-setup-template.md. Identified five specific gaps. Applied three targeted enrichments (~65 lines added): good/bad calibration pairs per character, pairwise interaction dynamics map, and operationalized intervention templates.
- **Documented all three skills in README and CLAUDE.md**: Added "Agent Skills" table to README (scannable, human-audience) and "Available Skills" section to CLAUDE.md (operational, agent-audience with "suggest when" guidance).

**Original Intent**: Review palgebra essay and integrate it; review committee skill quality; document skills.
**Actual Outcome**: All three tasks completed. Repo now has palgebra surfaced in README, committee skill substantially improved, and all three skills documented for both human and agent audiences.

## Mistakes and Lessons

### No major mistakes this session
The session was research-heavy (reading reference material, comparing documents) before making targeted edits. The plan-then-execute pattern worked well — no wasted edits.

### Minor observation: Edit tool requires fresh Read
The Edit tool rejected one edit because the file hadn't been read in the current context window. This is a known constraint — always Read immediately before Edit, even if you've seen the file content earlier.

## Dead Ends Explored

None. The session followed a linear path: read → analyze → plan → execute for each task.

## Current State

### Completed This Session
- **README.md**: Palgebra section added (lines 79-84), connecting paragraph (line 84), theory getting-started path updated (line 44), Agent Skills table added (lines 92-100)
- **CLAUDE.md**: Available Skills section added (lines 225-245)
- **.claude/skills/committee/SKILL.md**: Three enrichments — calibration pairs (lines 31-70), interaction dynamics (lines 72-88), intervention templates (lines 158-178)

### In Progress
- None. Clean stopping point.

### Not Yet Started (But Surfaced)
- **Independent evaluation not in committee skill**: The adversarial-committees.md describes passing debate transcripts to a separate model instance for RUBRIC-based scoring (5 criteria). The committee skill doesn't implement this. Worth considering for a future `/committee rigorous` enhancement.
- **Robert's Rules machinery not operationalized**: The skill mentions "rigorous" mode with Robert's Rules but doesn't include the procedural mechanics (motions seconded, speaking order, points of order, voting). The committee-setup-template.md has this in Template C. Could be added to the skill if `/committee rigorous` proves useful in practice.
- **More examples still needed**: Previous handoff noted the repo needs diverse examples beyond the hiring decision. Still true.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Test the enriched committee skill**: Run `/committee` on a real problem and see whether the calibration pairs and interaction dynamics actually improve output quality. The hypothesis is that characters will stay truer to their propensities and argue with each other more productively. If they don't, the calibration examples may need to be more prominent or repeated.

2. **Consider adding independent evaluation to committee skill**: This is the biggest missing piece. The methodology calls for passing debate output to a fresh model instance for rubric-based scoring. The skill currently skips this entirely. Could be a separate `/evaluate` skill or integrated into `/committee rigorous`.

3. **More examples** (carried over from previous handoff): Strategic pivot example, failure case example. The methodology needs diverse worked examples to prove generality.

## Working with mg: Session-Specific Insights

### Communication
- **Decisive and directive**: mg gives clear instructions ("Do C", "Propose a plan"). Doesn't need persuading — wants options presented, picks one, expects execution.
- **Trusts detailed analysis**: mg asked for a comparison of the committee skill against reference material and absorbed a lengthy analysis before making a decision. Appreciates thorough work when it's relevant.
- **Iterative builder**: mg works in a build-on-what-we-just-did pattern. Each task naturally led to the next: integrate palgebra → review committee skill → document skills. Let the session's momentum guide the agenda.

### Previous handoff observations validated
- **Theory-driven**: Confirmed. mg cares about how pieces relate conceptually, not just that they exist. The palgebra integration wasn't "add a link" — it required explaining the why/how/what-precisely relationship.
- **Completionist**: Confirmed. mg wanted all three skills documented, not just one.

## Open Questions

1. **Should the committee skill read character-propensity-reference.md at runtime?** The skill currently has compressed character descriptions. Option B from the analysis (have the skill read the full reference file) was not chosen in favor of Option C (targeted enrichment). But if the calibration pairs prove insufficient, reading the full 860-line reference at runtime might be worth the context window cost.

2. **Skill documentation maintenance**: Now that skills are documented in both README and CLAUDE.md, any new skill needs updates in three places (SKILL.md, README table, CLAUDE.md section). This could drift. Consider whether a single source of truth is better.

## Technical Notes

- **Skill files live in `.claude/skills/[name]/SKILL.md`**. Three exist: committee, string-diagram, handoff.
- **The string-diagram skill has supporting files**: `resource_equations_to_mermaid.py` (the converter), plus example equation files. No external dependencies.
- **agent/archive/ exists** and contains `handoff-2026-01-29.md`.

## Watch-Outs for Successor

- **The committee skill's calibration pairs are drawn verbatim from character-propensity-reference.md.** If those examples are updated in the reference, the skill should be updated too. They're duplicated, not linked.
- **README.md is getting long.** It now has: narrative computing intro, what is cyber-sense, who is this for, getting started, why does this matter, what's in this repository (essays, artifacts, palgebra, references, agent skills), core insights, why "cyber-sense", status, license. Adding more sections should be done cautiously — consider whether new content belongs in a sub-page instead.
- **CLAUDE.md mentions `/handoff` in two places now**: once in the Working Style section (line 221, original) and once in the Available Skills section (line 241-245, new). Both are accurate but slightly redundant. Not worth fixing — they serve different purposes (Working Style describes collaborative behavior; Available Skills is the operational reference).

## Theoretical/Conceptual Notes

### The skill-as-pipeline insight
The three skills map cleanly to palgebra concepts:
- `/committee` is a **transformation morphism**: problem-statement × character-roster → decision-space-map
- `/string-diagram` is a **representation isomorphism**: equations ↔ diagrams ↔ artifact files
- `/handoff` is an **enrichment morphism**: it doesn't change the repo content, it adds metadata (session context, lessons, next steps) to the agent/ directory

This could be worth making explicit somewhere — the skills are themselves examples of the formalism the repo describes.

### The calibration-pair pattern
Adding good/bad example pairs to the committee skill is essentially adding **few-shot examples** to steer generation. This is the same principle the methodology uses throughout: narrative exemplars constrain latent space traversal more effectively than abstract descriptions. The skill now practices what the methodology preaches.

## What Worked Well / What To Do Differently

### Worked well
- **Read thoroughly before proposing changes.** Reading all three reference files before analyzing the committee skill produced a much more grounded analysis than working from the skill alone would have.
- **Plan mode for multi-file changes.** Using plan mode for the README integration and skills documentation caught structural questions (where exactly to insert, what audience, what tone) before writing.
- **Targeted enrichment over wholesale expansion.** Adding ~65 lines to a ~300-line skill (20% increase) addressed the critical gaps without making the skill unwieldy. This was the right trade-off.

### Do differently
- Nothing major. The session was well-structured and productive.
