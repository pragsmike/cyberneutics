# Session Handoff: 2026-02-23 (Research-Programs Review and Condorcet Consolidation)

**Note:** This handoff combines two bodies of work: (1) the earlier research-programs restructure and ablation-study extract (implemented per plan; see archived handoff-2026-02-22), and (2) a follow-up session that reviewed research-programs, located the condorcet experiment, and consolidated it into the research-programs structure. The summary below reflects both.

---

## Session Summary

**Duration**: Two sessions (restructure + review/condorcet). Focus: establish research-programs as the home for plans and results; verify consistency and references; bring the pre-existing condorcet comparison experiment into the standard format.

**Main Accomplishments**

**From the restructure (first session):**
- Renamed `meta/research-plans/` → `meta/research-programs/`; scope now includes results and findings.
- Created `meta/research-programs/ablation-study.md` with full Design F plan (objective, procedure A1–A5, factor definitions S/C/D/E/R, run budget, results tabulation tables, status).
- Created `meta/research-programs/ablation-study/results/` with README placeholder.
- In `evaluation-schemes.md`: replaced Design F body with link to ablation-study; Phase 1 and success criteria link to plan/results.
- Added Conventions to research-programs README (where results go, how to record completed studies, archiving). Updated all repo references from research-plans to research-programs.

**From the review and condorcet consolidation (second session):**
- **Part 1 — Verified research-programs:** Read all five plan files and ablation results placeholder; checked references from meta/README, research-plan redirect, societies-of-thought-synthesis, methodology-evolution, references/README, gap_analysis, handoff-2026-02-22, CLAUDE.md. All paths correct; no stale references. Three minor inconsistencies noted (not fixed): `multi-model-committee.md`, `societies-of-thought-research-plan.md`, and `evaluation-schemes.md` lack the formal Status/Runs/Results header that conventions describe and `ablation-study.md` exemplifies (formatting only).
- **Part 2 — Condorcet experiment:** Located ~26 files across `agent/deliberations/`, `agent/comparisons/`, artifacts, and archive. Experiment compared deliberative committee pipeline vs. CJT-style independent-vote-then-aggregate on the same questions. Headline: on code-of-conduct, CJT-style gave Aye 3–2, deliberative gave Nay 5–0 (opposite verdicts; three votes flipped after enforcement/weaponization objection in debate). First empirical evidence for value of structured deliberation.
- **Part 3 — Condorcet research program:** Created `meta/research-programs/condorcet-comparison.md` (plan: objective, procedure, status, two runs with findings, limitations, link to evaluation-schemes). Created `condorcet-comparison/results/` and moved experimental records into it so the completed study is self-contained under research-programs (mg directed move-based approach after initial link-in-place plan).

**Files created (condorcet session):**
- `meta/research-programs/condorcet-comparison.md`
- `meta/research-programs/condorcet-comparison/results/README.md`
- `meta/research-programs/condorcet-comparison/results/comparisons-README.md` (provenance)
- `agent/research-programs-review-and-condorcet-plan.md` (review report and plan; updated when mg requested move)

**Files moved (26 files, 5 topic dirs):**
- `agent/comparisons/second-ci-job/*` → `condorcet-comparison/results/second-ci-job/`
- `agent/comparisons/code-of-conduct/*` → `condorcet-comparison/results/code-of-conduct/`
- `agent/deliberations/condorcet-jury-theorem-process/*` → `condorcet-comparison/results/condorcet-jury-theorem-process/`
- `agent/deliberations/second-ci-job/*` → `condorcet-comparison/results/second-ci-job-deliberation/`
- `agent/deliberations/code-of-conduct/*` → `condorcet-comparison/results/code-of-conduct-deliberation/`

**Files updated (12):** `agent/comparisons/README.md` (redirect stub), `meta/research-programs/README.md` (condorcet in priority table, completed table, by-theme), `evaluation-schemes.md` (existing evidence entry before Phase 1), `meta/README.md`, `artifacts/comparison-protocol-deliberative-vs-cjt.md`, `artifacts/adversarial-committees.md`, `artifacts/roberts-rules-forcing-function.md`, `meta/uptake-and-usage.md`, `meta/methodology-evolution.md`, and three archive files (handoff-2026-02-22-condorcet, condorcet-pr-review, ready-for-maintainer-review-2026-02-22) with redirect notes at top.

**Not moved:** Published artifacts (`condorcet-jury-theorem-and-committee.md`, `comparison-protocol-deliberative-vs-cjt.md`) and agent operational records (handoffs, PR review) stayed in place. Empty source directories under `agent/comparisons/` and `agent/deliberations/` could not be deleted (filesystem permissions) but are harmless.

**Original intent:** Restructure → verify → bring condorcet into research-programs in standard format.

**Actual outcome:** All done. Condorcet comparison is a completed research program with results under `meta/research-programs/condorcet-comparison/results/`. Grep confirmed no active docs point at old comparison/deliberation paths; only archive files retain old paths and have redirect notes.

---

## Mistakes and Lessons

- **Restructure session:** PowerShell `&&` invalid; use `;`. Table edits need exact string match (pipes, spaces).
- **Condorcet session:** Empty dirs under `agent/comparisons/` and `agent/deliberations/` could not be removed (permissions). Successor can remove them manually if desired; they are empty and safe to delete.

## Dead Ends Explored

None recorded for either session.

## Current State

### Completed

| Item | Location / note |
|------|------------------|
| research-programs | `meta/research-programs/` — plans + results; Conventions in README |
| ablation-study | Plan + results folder; Design F in evaluation-schemes is link-only |
| condorcet-comparison | Plan + results; 26 files moved from agent/ into program |
| comparisons redirect | `agent/comparisons/README.md` → research-programs condorcet-comparison |
| evaluation-schemes | "Existing evidence (completed)" cites condorcet before Phase 1 |
| Reference updates | All research-plans → research-programs; condorcet paths updated in 12 files |

### Optional / not done

- **Status header on three plans:** `multi-model-committee.md`, `societies-of-thought-research-plan.md`, `evaluation-schemes.md` do not yet have the Status/Runs/Results block that `ablation-study.md` and `condorcet-comparison.md` use. Conventions-compliant but cosmetic; can be added for consistency.
- **Empty agent dirs:** `agent/comparisons/<topic>/` and `agent/deliberations/<topic>/` for the moved runs are empty; deletion failed (permissions). Safe to remove by hand.

### Programs in meta/research-programs/

| Program | Status | Results |
|---------|--------|---------|
| societies-of-thought-research-plan | Active | — |
| evaluation-schemes | Umbrella (Designs A–F) | Phase 1 = ablation-study |
| ablation-study | Not started | ablation-study/results/ |
| condorcet-comparison | Completed (2 runs) | condorcet-comparison/results/ |
| multi-model-committee | Active | — |

---

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Optional:** Add Status/Runs/Results header to the three plans that lack it (multi-model-committee, societies-of-thought-research-plan, evaluation-schemes) for convention consistency.
2. **Optional:** Manually delete empty subdirs under `agent/comparisons/` and `agent/deliberations/` if filesystem allows.
3. **If mg approves:** Execute ablation-study or other evaluation-schemes phases (Design A, etc.); condorcet is already documented as "existing evidence."
4. **Comparative evaluation** (from prior handoff): One decision, three methods, same rubric — still pending mg's choice of decision.

## Working with mg: Session-Specific Insights

- **Plan then execute:** Restructure was proposed in plan mode, then implemented on approval ("B, move the material").
- **Commit when asked:** Explicit "Commit this" was used for research-programs work; no commit was requested for the condorcet consolidation in the summary provided.
- **Self-contained results:** mg directed that condorcet experimental results be **moved** into research-programs (not just linked in place) so the completed study lives under current protocols. That pattern applies to future retrofitted programs.

---

## Open Questions and Decisions Needed

- CI workflow (string-diagram test job): add or defer?
- Comparative evaluation: which decision for the three-method run?
- Execute ablation-study and/or multi-model-committee next?

---

## Technical Notes

- **agent/gap_analysis.md** remains in agent/; research-programs README links to it.
- **Condorcet results:** All run artifacts (deliberations, comparisons) now under `meta/research-programs/condorcet-comparison/results/`. Protocol and essay stay in `artifacts/`.
- **Archive files:** handoff-2026-02-22-condorcet, condorcet-pr-review, ready-for-maintainer-review-2026-02-22 have a note at top pointing to the new locations; they still mention old paths for history.

---

## Watch-Outs for Successor

- **Don’t look for comparison runs in agent/:** Deliberative vs. CJT comparison runs live under `meta/research-programs/condorcet-comparison/results/`. `agent/comparisons/README.md` is a redirect.
- **Research programs = plans + results:** New completed studies should get a plan file + results folder under research-programs and be added to README (priority table, completed table, by-theme). Use condorcet-comparison and ablation-study as templates.
- **Empty agent dirs:** If you remove them, only delete the specific topic subdirs that were moved (second-ci-job, code-of-conduct, condorcet-jury-theorem-process); keep `agent/comparisons/` and `agent/deliberations/` if future runs will write there before being folded into research-programs.

---

## Context for Specific Files

| File | Note |
|------|------|
| `meta/research-programs/README.md` | Conventions; condorcet in Highest row and Completed table. |
| `meta/research-programs/condorcet-comparison.md` | Plan + status + two runs; results in condorcet-comparison/results/. |
| `meta/research-programs/condorcet-comparison/results/` | second-ci-job, code-of-conduct, condorcet-jury-theorem-process, second-ci-job-deliberation, code-of-conduct-deliberation; comparisons-README.md for provenance. |
| `agent/comparisons/README.md` | Redirect only; points to condorcet-comparison program and results. |
| `agent/research-programs-review-and-condorcet-plan.md` | Full review report and plan produced by the agent that did the condorcet consolidation; updated after mg requested move. |
| `meta/research-programs/evaluation-schemes.md` | New "Existing evidence (completed)" before Phase 1 links to condorcet-comparison. |
