# Session Handoff: 2026-02-26 (Deliberation Evaluation Feedback Loop)

---

## Session Summary

**Duration**: Extended session across multiple phases, continuing from the diary-extraction session (archived as `handoff-2026-02-26-diary-extractions.md`).

**Original intent**: Read the committee deliberation on the Black Swan Hindsight Framework, evaluate the findings, devise amendments, and apply them to the research document.

**Actual outcome**: Full evaluation feedback loop completed across 6 phases:
1. Read the deliberation (Rounds 1-2), assessed committee findings, devised amendment plan
2. Applied amendments to `evaluating-deliberative-architectures.md` + wrote second independent evaluation (`04-evaluation-2.md`, 12/15)
3. Committed (`370259b`)
4. mg ran a remediation round (added Round 3 to deliberation, updated resolution to Fully Ratified, created `05-remediation-1.md`)
5. Conducted post-remediation evaluation (`06-evaluation-2.md`, 14/15)
6. Committed (`01b7959`)

**Key deliverables**:
- Major amendments to `meta/research-programs/evaluating-deliberative-architectures.md` (demoted Metric 3, recomposed corpus, added bias calibration protocol, added 2 new constructed scenarios, updated run budget and tables)
- `04-evaluation-2.md` — second independent review (12/15), diverging from first review (13/15) on Evidence Standards
- `06-evaluation-2.md` — post-remediation evaluation (14/15), confirming remediation addressed key gaps
- Cross-reference updates to `evaluation-schemes.md` and `research-programs/README.md`
- Results directory created (`evaluating-deliberative-architectures/results/.gitkeep`)

## The Evaluation Feedback Loop (What Actually Happened)

This session is the first complete traversal of the evaluation feedback loop described in the cyberneutics methodology: committee deliberation -> independent evaluation -> remediation -> re-evaluation. The score trajectory tells the story:

| Evaluation | Score | Key Gap |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| 04-evaluation-1.md (prior agent) | 13/15 | Topology mechanism missing, evaluator bias unchallenged |
| 04-evaluation-2.md (this session) | 12/15 | Same + corpus identity trade-off unacknowledged; scored Evidence Standards lower (1/3 vs 2/3) |
| 06-evaluation-2.md (this session) | 14/15 | Joe's "vanishingly thin slice" claim untested |

The drop from 13 to 12 between the two pre-remediation evaluations was deliberate and defensible: the second review applied stricter evidence standards (Vic abandoned prosecution of Maya's claim; Joe's empirical assertion went unchallenged). The rise to 14 after remediation confirms the feedback loop worked — the committee acknowledged specific failures and corrected them.

## Mistakes and Lessons

- **No significant mistakes in this session.** But I say that with the caveat from the 2026-02-24 handoff: "no mistakes encountered" often means "mistakes not yet discovered." The evaluation documents haven't been externally reviewed, and the amendments to the research program haven't been tested empirically.

- **Scoring divergence was productive, not a mistake.** My second evaluation (12/15) scored lower than the first (13/15). This wasn't a calibration error — I applied a stricter standard on Evidence Standards that the first evaluator did not. The divergence surfaced the specific gaps the remediation then fixed. If you're running evaluations, divergence between evaluators is signal, not noise.

## Dead Ends Explored

None. The amendment plan was approved and executed without revision. Each phase built cleanly on the previous one.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Execute Phase 1 of the Hindsight Framework**: Run contamination probes on candidate historical cases. This is the empirical test of Joe's "vanishingly thin slice" claim — the last gap flagged at 14/15. Finding 3-4 clean cases would close the gap; finding zero would confirm Joe's claim and shift the framework to constructed-case emphasis.

2. **Test the Evaluator Bias Calibration Protocol**: The new protocol (calibration pairs: rough-but-accurate vs eloquent-but-blind) is designed but untested. Running it on a pilot case before the full study would validate the measurement instrument.

3. **Consider a second remediation round**: The 14/15 evaluation identifies a clear path to 15/15 — Vic cross-examining Joe's claim with the same standard applied to Maya. mg could run this as a targeted remediation if the score matters, or accept 14/15 as sufficient for execution.

## Working with mg: Session-Specific Insights

- **mg runs the committee himself**: Between agent turns, mg wrote the remediation file, added Round 3 to the deliberation, and updated the resolution. The agent's role was evaluation and document amendment, not committee facilitation. This is a clean separation: mg generates deliberation content, agent evaluates it. This mirrors the evaluator/generator separation the methodology prescribes.

- **mg creates files between turns without announcement**: The remediation files appeared between my two commits. Don't assume you know the full state of the repository — always `git status` before committing.

- **mg expects compound execution**: Instructions like "commit the changes" or "conduct another evaluation" are compound requests that expect the agent to figure out scope (which files to commit, what naming convention for the evaluation file).

- **mg values honest scoring over diplomatic scoring**: The second evaluation (12/15) scored lower than the first (13/15) and mg didn't push back — he ran a remediation to address the gaps. Score honestly, even if it means scoring lower than a prior evaluation.

---

## Open Questions and Decisions Needed

- **Is 14/15 sufficient to proceed with execution?** The path to 15/15 is clear (test Joe's claim) but may not be worth a remediation round if mg wants to move to empirical work.
- **How many candidate historical cases exist?** Joe's claim that the intersection is "nearly empty" is the central open empirical question. Running contamination probes on 5-6 candidates would answer it.
- **Prior open questions**: Pask mesh rename, rubric persistence, plugin license, Cowork runtime testing.

---

## Technical Notes

- **Deliberation file naming convention**: The deliberation directory uses a numeric prefix scheme: `00-charter`, `01-convening`, `01-roster`, `02-deliberation`, `03-resolution`, `04-evaluation-N`, `05-remediation-N`, `06-evaluation-N`. Evaluations after remediations increment the prefix by 2 (04 -> 06 -> 08). The suffix number tracks which evaluator wrote it (evaluation-1 = first evaluator, evaluation-2 = second evaluator).

- **The research document has split results tables**: Tables 1a (Historical) and 1b (Constructed) are separate and must never be aggregated. This was a deliberate committee decision to preserve the distinction between historical ground truth and structural recognition testing.

- **Run budget decreased**: Amendments reduced the run budget from 72 to 56 runs by demoting P1 (topology) from a full condition to a qualitative check within each C-condition run.

- **Two new constructed scenarios**: "Information Asymmetry" (IX-B) and "Cascading Mitigation" (IX-C) were added alongside the existing Glenda/Crock and Blast Radius scenarios. Each has full protocol text, success criteria, and scoring rubrics.

---

## Watch-Outs for Successor

- **Don't re-aggregate Tables 1a and 1b.** The separate reporting was a hard-won committee decision. If you're tempted to combine historical and constructed case scores, re-read the Round 3 discussion on purity vs. reality.

- **The Metric 3 demotion is structural, not a bug.** Decision Landscape Topology was demoted to a qualitative convergence check because N=3 is statistically meaningless AND static prompts cannot map topology (they map softmax sampling noise). Don't try to rehabilitate it without addressing both issues.

- **mg edits files between turns.** Read files fresh before operating on them. The deliberation transcript, resolution, and remediation file were all created by mg between agent turns.

- **Evaluation scoring must cite specific transcript passages.** The `/review` skill requires citations. Don't give rubric scores without quoting the relevant committee member's statement. Both evaluations in this session follow this pattern rigorously.

---

## Theoretical/Conceptual Notes

- **The evaluation feedback loop is now empirically validated (on itself).** This session is the first time the full cycle — deliberation -> evaluation -> remediation -> re-evaluation — has been run to completion. The score trajectory (13/12 -> 14) demonstrates that external evaluation materially improves deliberation quality. The committee's self-correction in Round 3 (Vic acknowledging his prosecution failure, Maya conceding the unfalsifiable form of her claim) would not have happened without the evaluation feedback.

- **Evaluator divergence is a feature.** Two evaluators scoring the same transcript at 13/15 and 12/15 is not a calibration problem — it surfaced different gaps. The first evaluator caught the topology mechanism gap; the second caught the evidence asymmetry (Maya held to account, Joe not). Both were addressed in remediation.

- **The "purity vs. reality" axis is the framework's deepest tension.** Joe named it in Round 3: historical cases are muddy but real; constructed cases are clean but artificial. The separate-reporting resolution is honest but doesn't resolve the tension — it makes it visible. Any execution of the framework will need to decide how much weight to give each type of evidence when drawing conclusions.

## What Worked Well / What To Do Differently

**Worked well**:
- Scoring lower than the first evaluator (12 vs 13) surfaced the exact gaps remediation needed to fix
- Reading the full deliberation before writing evaluations (rather than skimming) caught the specific moments where prosecution failed
- Applying amendments to the research document in the same session as writing the evaluation created tight coherence between the two
- The compound session structure (evaluate -> amend -> commit -> re-evaluate -> commit) maintained momentum across phases

**Do differently**:
- Could have flagged to mg that the remediation files would need to be committed along with the evaluation — instead I discovered them in `git status` and committed them together, which worked fine but wasn't planned
- The first commit included both the research amendments and 04-evaluation-2.md in a single commit; these could have been separate commits for cleaner history (amendments = one concern, evaluation = another)

---

## Context for Specific Files

- **`meta/research-programs/evaluating-deliberative-architectures.md`**: The core research document. Has been through two major edit rounds: initial expansion (prior session, 49->400+ lines) and amendment (this session, addressing committee findings). Currently at its most mature state. Next action: empirical execution.

- **`agent/deliberations/eval-delib-architectures/`**: Complete deliberation record with 8 files (00-06 plus roster). The full evaluation feedback loop is preserved. If running future deliberations, this directory is the reference implementation of the feedback loop.

- **`04-evaluation-2.md`**: My second independent review. Key divergence from 04-evaluation-1.md: stricter Evidence Standards (1/3 vs 2/3) and flagging of the corpus-identity trade-off. This was the evaluation that drove the most remediation action.

- **`06-evaluation-2.md`**: Post-remediation evaluation. Score 14/15. The only remaining gap (Joe's untested claim) is documented with a specific prescription for how to close it.
