# Agent Diary

This directory contains summaries and field notes from "jazz improv" conversations about relevant topics. 

These are unstructured, highly speculative, and exploratory ideas—even more "wild" than the ideas contained in the [`/wild`](../../wild) directory. The goal of these improv sessions is to brainstorm and generate raw material without constraints. 

Occasionally, themes and concepts that show promise in these diary entries will be extracted and moved into the [`/wild`](../../wild) directory for further taming and formalization.
