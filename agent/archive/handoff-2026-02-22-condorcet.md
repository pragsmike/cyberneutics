# Session Handoff: 2026-02-22 (Condorcet Contributor Session)

**Archived from**: `agent/handoff-2026-02-22.md` (split out — this session's content was merged with the wild-material verification session in the original file).

**Note (2026-02-24):** The comparison and deliberation records listed below (`agent/comparisons/second-ci-job/`, `agent/comparisons/code-of-conduct/`, `agent/deliberations/condorcet-jury-theorem-process/`, `agent/deliberations/second-ci-job/`, `agent/deliberations/code-of-conduct/`) were moved to `meta/research-programs/condorcet-comparison/results/` as part of consolidating the condorcet experiment into a research program. See [meta/research-programs/condorcet-comparison.md](../../meta/research-programs/condorcet-comparison.md).

## Session Summary

**Duration:** Single session. User asked for an in-depth repository review and run/test guidance, then ran committee and comparison work (CI, Condorcet, deliberative vs. CJT-style).

**Main Accomplishments:**

- **Repository review and run/test guide** (`meta/repository-review-and-run-guide.md`). What the repo is (docs + one script, skills in AI session), how to run (skills in chat, Python script), how to test (smoke test, structural checks, manual methodology validation). `meta/README.md` updated.
- **Smoke test for string-diagram script** (`scripts/test_string_diagram.py`). Runs the equation→Mermaid converter on the three equation files; exit 0 and "flowchart" check. No deps. Run from repo root: `python scripts/test_string_diagram.py`.
- **CI job deliberation** (`agent/deliberations/ci-string-diagram-test/`). Committee: add CI that runs the smoke test, with documented scope. Review scored 9/15; remediation added Round 2 (Vic→Joe, Frankie→Maya, Joe clarified environment claim). Resolution: add CI; not yet implemented (maintainer to add workflow if desired).
- **Condorcet jury theorem** — Committee deliberation (`agent/deliberations/condorcet-jury-theorem-process/`): recommend document, don't change process. Review 13/15 (High). **Artifact created:** `artifacts/condorcet-jury-theorem-and-committee.md` (design goals first, CJT as analogy, deviations, CJT-compliant = different pipeline). Link added in `artifacts/adversarial-committees.md`.
- **Comparison protocol** (`artifacts/comparison-protocol-deliberative-vs-cjt.md`). How to run deliberative vs. CJT-style (independent vote then aggregate) on the same question and compare.
- **Two comparison runs:**
  - **second-ci-job:** CJT Nay 4–1, Deliberative Nay 5–0 (same verdict; Frankie moved Aye→Nay, revisit condition added).
  - **code-of-conduct:** **CJT Aye 3–2, Deliberative Nay 5–0 (opposite verdicts).** Three votes flipped after debate on enforcement/weaponization.
- **Comparison records:** `agent/comparisons/` with README; `agent/comparisons/second-ci-job/`, `agent/comparisons/code-of-conduct/` (00-charter, CJT-style votes, deliberative summary, comparison summary each).

**Original intent:** In-depth review, run/test guidance, then hand back to maintainer for review.

**Actual outcome:** Review + runbook, smoke test, two committee runs (CI, Condorcet), Condorcet artifact, comparison protocol, two comparison runs showing same vs. different outcomes. Ready for maintainer review.

## Mistakes and Lessons

- **None material.** Slash commands were clarified (chat vs. terminal) when user tried `/committee` in PowerShell.
- **Lesson:** Comparison runs need a value-laden or enforcement-sensitive question to get divergent results; second-ci-job agreed, code-of-conduct disagreed.

| `agent/deliberations/condorcet-jury-theorem-process/` | **New.** Committee + review (00–04). Resolution: document CJT, don't change process. |

| `agent/comparisons/README.md` | **New.** Index of comparison runs. |
| `agent/comparisons/second-ci-job/` | **New.** Charter, CJT-style votes, result, deliberative summary, comparison summary. |
| `agent/comparisons/code-of-conduct/` | **New.** Same structure; shows opposite verdicts (CJT Aye, Deliberative Nay). |
| `agent/deliberations/second-ci-job/` | **New.** Deliberative run for second-CI-job comparison. |
| `agent/deliberations/code-of-conduct/` | **New.** Deliberative run for code-of-conduct comparison. |

### In Progress

- **Nothing.** All planned work this session is complete.

### Carried Forward (from previous handoffs, still relevant)

- Quickstart guide: add when-methodology-fails.md reference (low effort).
- Comparative evaluation (one decision, three methods, same rubric) — committee's #1 evidence gap; we did two deliberative-vs-CJT comparisons instead.
- `/probe` still untested; `/review` on methodology-adoption (scenario-aware) not run.
- Roster customization workflow undocumented; integration-with-moollm.md hardcodes roster.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Maintainer review:** Read this handoff and `agent/ready-for-maintainer-review.md` (if present); skim new artifacts and comparison summaries; run `python scripts/test_string_diagram.py` locally if desired.
2. **Commit:** New and modified files are ready. Suggested scope: meta/, scripts/, artifacts/, agent/deliberations/, agent/comparisons/.
3. **Optional — add CI:** Committee recommended adding a CI job that runs `scripts/test_string_diagram.py` with documented scope. Implement only if maintainer agrees.
4. **Optional — quickstart:** Add when-methodology-fails.md to quick-start recommended reading (carried from prior handoff).

## Ready for Maintainer Review

### What was added (for review)

- **Docs:** `meta/repository-review-and-run-guide.md`, `artifacts/condorcet-jury-theorem-and-committee.md`, `artifacts/comparison-protocol-deliberative-vs-cjt.md`.
- **Test:** `scripts/test_string_diagram.py` (smoke test; run from repo root).
- **Deliberations:** `agent/deliberations/ci-string-diagram-test/` (with remediation), `agent/deliberations/condorcet-jury-theorem-process/`, `agent/deliberations/second-ci-job/`, `agent/deliberations/code-of-conduct/`.
- **Comparisons:** `agent/comparisons/` (README + second-ci-job + code-of-conduct). Code-of-conduct run shows **deliberative vs. CJT-style giving opposite verdicts** (Aye vs. Nay).

### Suggested maintainer actions

1. **Review** this handoff and, if helpful, `meta/repository-review-and-run-guide.md`.
2. **Run** `python scripts/test_string_diagram.py` locally (should see three OK lines).
3. **Skim** `artifacts/condorcet-jury-theorem-and-committee.md` and `agent/comparisons/code-of-conduct/04-comparison-summary.md` to see Condorcet doc and comparison result.
4. **Decide** whether to add the CI workflow (committee recommended it; implementation not done).
5. **Commit** when satisfied (all new/modified files under meta/, scripts/, artifacts/, agent/ as above).

### Open questions for maintainer

- Add the CI job now, or leave for later?
- Keep comparison runs under `agent/comparisons/` as-is, or move/rename?
- Anything to change in the Condorcet artifact or comparison protocol before treating as final?

## Working with mg: Session-Specific Insights

- User (or mg) requested clear hand-off for maintainer review; structured "ready for review" and file list support that.
- Comparison runs were user-driven (CI topic, then Condorcet, then "something that gives different results" → code-of-conduct). Maintainer may want to run more comparisons or treat these as sufficient for now.

## Open Questions and Decisions Needed

1. **CI workflow:** Implement the committee's recommendation (add CI for `scripts/test_string_diagram.py`) or defer?
2. **Comparative evaluation** (from prior handoff): The full "one decision, three methods, same rubric" study is still the committee's #1 evidence gap. This session did two deliberative-vs-CJT comparisons instead. Proceed with full comparative evaluation later?
3. **Comparison runs:** Keep under `agent/comparisons/` and reference from run guide or README?

## Technical Notes

- **Slash commands:** `/committee`, `/review`, etc. run in **Cursor chat**, not in the terminal. Terminal is for `python scripts/test_string_diagram.py` and similar.
- **Two deliberation dirs for same topic:** second-ci-job and code-of-conduct each have both `agent/deliberations/<slug>/` (deliberative) and `agent/comparisons/<slug>/` (charter + CJT-style + comparison summary). Deliberative is the full transcript; comparison dir points to it and holds CJT-style votes and 04-comparison-summary.

## Session Metadata
