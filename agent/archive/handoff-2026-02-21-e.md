# Session Handoff: 2026-02-21 (fourth session)

## Session Summary

**Duration**: Single session. Continues from the third session (archived as `agent/archive/handoff-2026-02-21-d.md`) which tested the deliberated-choice workflow. This session delivered one of the four robust actions from the methodology-adoption-strategy committee.

**Main Accomplishments**:
- **`when-methodology-fails.md` essay written and published.** The adoption-strategy committee had recommended this as one of four robust actions by Q2 2026; Maya called it "the single most credibility-building thing the project could produce." The essay maps six failure modes (problem doesn't warrant it, characters don't deliver, evaluation loop doesn't escape hermeneutic circle, user abdicates editorial role, garbage in/sophisticated garbage out, meta-circularity trap), each with concrete scenarios, mechanisms, detection heuristics, and recovery strategies. Includes a scope map (when to use full pipeline vs. committee alone vs. quick propensity check vs. nothing) and a self-application section.
- **Committee deliberation to evaluate the essay.** Ran `/committee` on the essay's quality and uptake impact. Verdict: publish with minor revisions. Committee identified four specific revisions; all were applied.
- **Revisions applied per committee feedback**: (1) empirical caveat — failure modes are predicted, not empirically documented; (2) expanded unknown-unknowns treatment in self-application section; (3) power asymmetry sub-failure in Failure Mode 4; (4) model capability degradation note in Failure Mode 2.
- **Integration**: Essay added to essays/README.md (Skeptics path + Core Essays section). gap_analysis.md updated (when-methodology-fails marked complete).

**Original intent**: mg asked to read the adoption-strategy committee transcript, take their advice on which essay to write (when-methodology-fails), think deeply about failure modes, devise evaluation criteria and a plan, write the essay, run a committee to evaluate it, and apply their recommendations.

**Actual outcome**: Full execution. Essay written, committee evaluated, revisions applied. One committee recommendation not yet done: reference the essay in the quickstart guide as recommended reading before first committee use.

## Mistakes and Lessons

- **No execution mistakes.** The essay was written to a plan, the committee deliberation produced actionable feedback, and revisions were applied systematically.
- **Quickstart guide update deferred**: The committee recommended adding the essay to the quickstart guide as prerequisite reading. This was not done — the session focused on the essay itself and the evaluation deliberation. Low-effort follow-up for successor.
- **Lesson**: The committee's evaluation deliberation was valuable. Maya's "credibility theater" concern, Vic's empirical-caveat demand, and the expanded unknown-unknowns treatment all improved the essay. Running the methodology on its own outputs (committee evaluating committee-produced essay) produced genuine stress-testing, not rubber-stamping.

## Dead Ends Explored

None. The session followed a linear path: read committee → read essays/artifacts → analyze failure modes → devise rubric → plan → write essay → run evaluation committee → apply revisions.

## Current State

### Deliberately Untouched

- **Quickstart guide**: Committee recommended referencing the essay there; not done this session.
- **Spec calibration from test**: Resolution YAML schema, etc. — still open from previous session.
- **Remediation flow test**: is-author-crackpot — still open.

### In Progress

- **Nothing**; all planned work is complete.

### Carried Forward (from previous handoffs, still relevant)

- **Remediation flow test**: is-author-crackpot (sum 11 < 13). Open since 2026-02-20.
- **Roster customization workflow**: Still undocumented. Open since 2026-02-20.
- **integration-with-moollm.md**: Still hardcodes roster by name. Open since 2026-02-20.
- **Spec calibration from test**: Three items (resolution YAML schema, scenarios assumption minimum count, charter bridge `key_assumption`). Open.
- **`/probe` still untested**: Last untested skill.
- **Adoption-strategy robust actions**: One of four done (when-methodology-fails). Remaining: Start Here guide, worked example, monitoring infrastructure.

### New items from this session

- **Essay evaluation committee**: `agent/deliberations/when-methodology-fails-evaluation/` — first committee run to evaluate a *document* rather than a decision. The format worked; the committee produced specific, actionable revisions.
- **Four deliberation directories now**: testing-deliberated-choice-workflow (meta), methodology-adoption-strategy (test subject), when-methodology-fails-evaluation (essay quality). Don't confuse purposes.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Quickstart guide update** (low effort): Add reference to when-methodology-fails.md as recommended reading before first committee use. Committee explicitly recommended this.
2. **Commit**: All new/modified files are ready. mg commits himself.
3. **Remediation flow test** (carried): Run on is-author-crackpot.
4. **Remaining robust actions** (if desired): Start Here guide, worked example, monitoring infrastructure. These are editorial decisions for mg.
5. **`/review` on methodology-adoption deliberation** (carried): Would test whether review skill handles scenario-aware resolution format. Not run in previous session.
6. **`/probe` test**: Last untested skill. Expensive (N× full pipeline).

## Working with mg: Session-Specific Insights

- **Compound instruction with full autonomy**: mg gave a single long instruction (read committee → take advice → think deeply → devise rubric → plan → write → run committee → evaluate). No intermediate checkpoints. The agent planned and executed autonomously. This matches the pattern from the previous session (testing workflow).
- **No "don't modify" constraint this session**: Unlike the testing session, mg did not restrict this session to additions only. The essay, essays/README.md, and gap_analysis.md were all modified. The constraint was session-specific.
- **Handoff at session end** (confirmed): mg invoked `/handoff` immediately after the work. Same pattern as previous sessions.

## Open Questions and Decisions Needed

1. **Adoption strategy: Does mg want external adoption?** (Carried from previous session.) Maya's flag: if The Scholarly Archive is the desired outcome, the robust actions are overhead.
2. **Quickstart guide update**: Committee recommended it. Low effort. Should it be done in next session or batched with other edits?
3. **Probe cost**: `/probe` at N=3 is expensive. Abbreviated runs acceptable?
4. **Roster customization workflow** (carried): Still undocumented.
5. **Composed `/decide` skill** (carried): Manual composition works. Time to compose?

## Technical Notes

- **No code execution**: All outputs were Markdown. No Python, no build steps.
- **Committee skill used without scenario_context**: The essay evaluation was a standard committee run (no scenarios). The charter asked "Is the essay good enough? Will it help uptake?" — a decision question, not a situation requiring exploration.

## Watch-Outs for Successor

- **Four deliberation directories, three purposes**: (1) `testing-deliberated-choice-workflow/` — meta-deliberation (how to test); (2) `methodology-adoption-strategy/` — scenario-aware deliberation (test subject); (3) `when-methodology-fails-evaluation/` — document evaluation (essay quality). The assessment (04-evaluation-1.md) lives in the testing directory and evaluates the methodology-adoption run, not the essay run.
- **Essay evaluation committee has no 04-evaluation**: The when-methodology-fails-evaluation deliberation was not run through `/review`. The committee's verdict is in 03-resolution.md. Running `/review` on it would test whether the review skill handles standard (non-scenario-aware) deliberations correctly — and would provide rubric scores for the evaluation committee's own transcript.
- **when-methodology-fails.md is self-referential**: The essay was written by an LLM and discusses LLM limitations. The self-application section addresses this explicitly. Don't treat the essay as externally validated — it's a predicted failure-mode inventory, not an empirical report.

## Theoretical/Conceptual Notes

- **Failure modes trace to theoretical claims**: Each failure mode in the essay connects to a specific load-bearing claim (Deleuzian repetition→difference, evaluation loop breaking hermeneutic circle, user as editor, etc.). The essay's value is partly that it identifies which theoretical foundations are most at risk when things go wrong.
- **Scope map as decision framework**: The "when to use what" section is the most practically valuable part. Practitioners can read it before investing and decide whether the methodology fits their problem. This is the self-selection effect Tammy identified — reducing undifferentiated adoption in favor of successful adoption.
- **Credibility paradox**: The essay warns that documenting limitations can paradoxically increase trust ("they're so honest!"). The committee debated whether the essay falls into this trap. Maya's view: naming the paradox doesn't escape it. The essay's self-application section addresses this; the expanded unknown-unknowns treatment tightens it.

## What Worked Well / What To Do Differently

- **Committee-as-evaluator**: Using the committee to evaluate the essay was productive. The committee produced specific revisions (empirical caveat, unknown unknowns, power asymmetry, model degradation) that improved the essay. The format — charter asking "is this good enough? what's missing?" — worked for document evaluation.
- **Plan-then-execute**: Devising the rubric and plan before writing focused the essay. The structure (scenario → mechanism → detection → recovery → theory connection for each failure mode) was decided upfront.
- **Deep reading before writing**: Reading 15+ essays and artifacts before analyzing failure modes gave the essay specificity. The failure modes reference concrete components (character propensities, rubrics, evaluation loop, charter bridge) rather than abstract hand-waving.
- **Could improve**: The quickstart guide update was identified but not done. Should have been done in the same session.
