# Session Handoff: 2026-02-21 (sixth session)

## Session Summary

**Duration**: Single session. Continues from the fifth session (archived as `agent/archive/handoff-2026-02-21-f.md`) which delivered Start Here path, full-pipeline worked example, and README link fixes. This session ran a fresh is-author-crackpot committee deliberation on the expanded repo, reviewed it, remediated it, and wrote a meta summary document.

**Main Accomplishments**:
- **Fresh is-author-crackpot deliberation** (`agent/deliberations/is-author-crackpot-revisited/`). Full committee run (00-charter through 03-resolution) assessing the crackpot question against the current repo state (18 essays, 17+ artifacts, 5 palgebra docs, 5 deliberations, onboarding docs). Verdict: not a crackpot, probability shifted from 60% competent-overtheorized / 25% genuinely-innovative to 45% competent-toolkit / 35% genuinely-innovative (post-remediation numbers).
- **Independent review** (04-evaluation-1.md). Scored 12/15, below 13-point threshold. Flagged: premature unanimity on primary question, Vic's concession on monad nesting underscrutinized, probability distribution uncalibrated.
- **Remediation round** (05-remediation-1.md + Round 3 appended to 02-deliberation.md). Maya steelmanned the closed-loop-explains-everything reading. Vic constructed a concrete nesting failure (assumption inheritance in nested fan→funnel). Probability distribution moderated and anchored to observable evidence. Resolution updated.
- **Meta summary** (`meta/is-author-crackpot.md`). User-facing document explaining the question, giving the probability table across both runs, narrating the debate history with commentary, and listing calibration anchors. `meta/README.md` updated to include it.

**Original intent**: User wanted to re-run the is-author-crackpot debate on the current repo contents. Asked for fresh run (not extension of old). After deliberation + review + remediation, asked for a meta summary document instead of a second review.

**Actual outcome**: Full execution of the deliberation pipeline including remediation, plus the meta document. The old deliberation at `agent/deliberations/is-author-crackpot/` is preserved.

## Immediate Next Steps (at time of handoff)

1. **Comparative evaluation** (high value, from committee): Would address the biggest remaining evidence gap.
2. **Commit**: New/modified files ready.
3. **Quickstart guide update** (low effort): Add when-methodology-fails.md reference.
4. **`/review` on methodology-adoption deliberation**: Test review skill on scenario-aware resolution format.
5. **`/probe` test**: Last untested skill; expensive (N× full pipeline).

## Session Metadata

**Date**: 2026-02-21  
**Status**: Full deliberation pipeline completed including remediation; meta document created  
**Continuation priority**: Comparative evaluation; then quickstart, `/review` on methodology-adoption, `/probe` test.
