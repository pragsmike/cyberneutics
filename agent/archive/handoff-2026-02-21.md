# Session Handoff: 2026-02-21 (sixth session)

## Session Summary

**Duration**: Single session. Continues from the fifth session (archived as `agent/archive/handoff-2026-02-21-f.md`) which delivered Start Here path, full-pipeline worked example, and README link fixes. This session ran a fresh is-author-crackpot committee deliberation on the expanded repo, reviewed it, remediated it, and wrote a meta summary document.

**Main Accomplishments**:
- **Fresh is-author-crackpot deliberation** (`agent/deliberations/is-author-crackpot-revisited/`). Full committee run (00-charter through 03-resolution) assessing the crackpot question against the current repo state (18 essays, 17+ artifacts, 5 palgebra docs, 5 deliberations, onboarding docs). Verdict: not a crackpot, probability shifted from 60% competent-overtheorized / 25% genuinely-innovative to 45% competent-toolkit / 35% genuinely-innovative (post-remediation numbers).
- **Independent review** (04-evaluation-1.md). Scored 12/15, below 13-point threshold. Flagged: premature unanimity on primary question, Vic's concession on monad nesting underscrutinized, probability distribution uncalibrated.
- **Remediation round** (05-remediation-1.md + Round 3 appended to 02-deliberation.md). Maya steelmanned the closed-loop-explains-everything reading. Vic constructed a concrete nesting failure (assumption inheritance in nested fan→funnel). Probability distribution moderated and anchored to observable evidence. Resolution updated.
- **Meta summary** (`meta/is-author-crackpot.md`). User-facing document explaining the question, giving the probability table across both runs, narrating the debate history with commentary, and listing calibration anchors. `meta/README.md` updated to include it.

**Original intent**: User wanted to re-run the is-author-crackpot debate on the current repo contents. Asked for fresh run (not extension of old). After deliberation + review + remediation, asked for a meta summary document instead of a second review.

**Actual outcome**: Full execution of the deliberation pipeline including remediation, plus the meta document. The old deliberation at `agent/deliberations/is-author-crackpot/` is preserved.

## Immediate Next Steps (at time of handoff)

1. **Comparative evaluation** (high value, from committee): Would address the biggest remaining evidence gap.
2. **Commit**: New/modified files ready.
3. **Quickstart guide update** (low effort): Add when-methodology-fails.md reference.
4. **`/review` on methodology-adoption deliberation**: Test review skill on scenario-aware resolution format.
5. **`/probe` test**: Last untested skill; expensive (N× full pipeline).

## Session Metadata

**Date**: 2026-02-21  
**Status**: Full deliberation pipeline completed including remediation; meta document created  
**Continuation priority**: Comparative evaluation; then quickstart, `/review` on methodology-adoption, `/probe` test.

## Mistakes and Lessons

- **No execution mistakes in pipeline.** Charter, roster, convening, deliberation, resolution, review, remediation all produced cleanly.
- **Lesson: fresh run was the right call.** The delta between the two deliberations (Feb 17 vs Feb 21) is genuinely informative. The first run's five-gap framework provided structure for the second run to evaluate against. Extending the old debate would have anchored on the old framing.
- **Lesson: the closed-loop problem is the real finding.** The most interesting output isn't the probability distribution — it's Maya's steelmanned argument that every positive signal is consistent with AI-assisted gap-filling. The committee honestly concluded this is underdetermined by internal evidence. This is a structural insight about AI-assisted intellectual projects in general, not just this repo.
- **Lesson: remediation materially improved the deliberation.** Pre-remediation distribution (45% innovative, 40% toolkit) was overconfident. Post-remediation (35% innovative, 45% toolkit) is more defensible because it was stress-tested against the closed-loop reading and anchored to specific observable evidence. The evaluation-remediation loop worked as designed.

## Dead Ends Explored

None.

## Current State

### Completed This Session

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| `agent/deliberations/is-author-crackpot-revisited/` | **New directory.** Full deliberation record: 00-charter, 01-roster, 01-convening, 02-deliberation (3 rounds + remediation round), 03-resolution, 04-evaluation-1, 05-remediation-1. |
| `meta/is-author-crackpot.md` | **New.** Summary of both crackpot deliberations with probability table, debate history, calibration anchors. |
| `meta/README.md` | **Modified.** Added is-author-crackpot.md entry. |

### In Progress

- **Nothing**; all planned work this session is complete.

### Carried Forward (from previous handoffs, still relevant)

- **Quickstart guide update**: Reference when-methodology-fails.md as recommended reading. Not yet done.
- **Remaining robust action**: Monitoring infrastructure (monthly GitHub analytics, quarterly uptake review, citation alerts). Q2 2026.
- **Remediation flow test on original is-author-crackpot**: Still at sum 11 < 13. The *revisited* deliberation went through its own remediation, but the original deliberation's remediation flow was never completed. Low priority now — the revisited run supersedes it for the crackpot question.
- **Roster customization workflow**: Still undocumented.
- **integration-with-moollm.md**: Still hardcodes roster by name.
- **Spec calibration from test**: Resolution YAML schema, scenarios assumption minimum count, charter bridge key_assumption.
- **`/probe` still untested**: Last untested skill.
- **`/review` on methodology-adoption deliberation**: Would test whether review skill handles scenario-aware resolution format. Not run.
- **Comparative evaluation** (new, from committee recommendation): Run one real decision through full pipeline, simple prompt, and multi-perspective prompt. Score all three on same rubric. Highest-value evidence the project could produce. Committee identified this as the single most important next step across both deliberation runs.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Comparative evaluation** (high value, from committee): Would address the biggest remaining evidence gap. Requires picking a real decision, running it three ways, and scoring honestly. This is the most important thing the project could do next for credibility.
2. **Commit**: New/modified files ready. Six new files in deliberations + 2 in meta.
3. **Quickstart guide update** (low effort, carried): Add when-methodology-fails.md reference.
4. **`/review` on methodology-adoption deliberation** (carried): Test review skill on scenario-aware resolution format.
5. **`/probe` test** (carried): Last untested skill; expensive (N× full pipeline).

## Working with mg: Session-Specific Insights

- **Strategic about debate structure**: mg decided on fresh run rather than extension, with clear reasoning (the delta is more informative than an update). Shows understanding of the methodology's own principles (repetition produces difference).
- **Knows when to stop the pipeline**: After review + remediation, mg declined a second review and instead asked for a meta summary document. This is editorial judgment — the deliberation record is for process; the meta document is for audience. mg was thinking about what a reader needs, not what the pipeline produces.
- **Comfortable with self-referential evaluation**: Running the methodology's own adversarial committee on the question of whether the author is a crackpot, and publishing the result, requires a specific kind of intellectual confidence. Not confidence that the answer will be favorable — confidence that the process will be honest.

## Open Questions and Decisions Needed

1. **Comparative evaluation**: Does mg want to do this? It's the highest-value evidence but also the most likely to produce an uncomfortable result. The committee explicitly noted: "Publish the comparison, including if the methodology doesn't win clearly."
2. **Original is-author-crackpot remediation**: The revisited run supersedes it for the crackpot question. Archive the original's incomplete remediation state, or leave it? Low stakes.
3. **Adoption strategy** (carried): Does mg want external adoption? If Scholarly Archive is desired, comparative evaluation and external engagement are overhead.
4. **Probe cost** (carried): `/probe` at N=3 expensive. Abbreviated runs acceptable?
5. **Composed `/decide` skill** (carried): Manual composition works. Time to formalize?

## Technical Notes

- **Two deliberation directories for the same question**: `agent/deliberations/is-author-crackpot/` (Feb 17, original) and `agent/deliberations/is-author-crackpot-revisited/` (Feb 21, fresh run). Both preserved. The meta document at `meta/is-author-crackpot.md` links to both.
- **Remediation appended to 02-deliberation.md**: The remediation round (Response to Evaluation + Round 3 + Revised Final Consensus) was appended directly to the deliberation transcript per the skill spec. The file is long (~445 lines).
- **Resolution was overwritten**: 03-resolution.md was fully rewritten post-remediation to reflect the moderated probability distribution and calibration anchors.

## Watch-Outs for Successor

- **Don't confuse the two crackpot deliberations**: `is-author-crackpot` is the Feb 17 original (incomplete remediation, sum 11). `is-author-crackpot-revisited` is the Feb 21 fresh run (remediated, sum 12 pre-remediation). The meta document at `meta/is-author-crackpot.md` is the user-facing summary of both.
- **The closed-loop problem is a general insight**: Maya's steelmanned argument — that all positive evidence from an AI-assisted project is consistent with AI gap-filling — applies to any AI-assisted intellectual work. If this surfaces in future deliberations, reference the crackpot-revisited Round 3.
- **Calibration anchors are commitments**: The probability distribution in 03-resolution.md has specific anchors (e.g., "independent practitioner reports pipeline surfaced unavailable insight → +10%"). If any of these evidence events actually occur, the distribution should be updated accordingly.

## Theoretical/Conceptual Notes

- **Underdetermination as structural feature**: The committee's key finding isn't a verdict — it's that internal evidence cannot discriminate between "genuine innovation" and "competent AI-assisted gap-filling." This is a cybernetic observation: a system with only internal feedback cannot distinguish real growth from self-referential elaboration. The methodology's own theoretical framework (second-order cybernetics, observer dependence) predicts this limitation.
- **The question shifted**: From "is the author a crackpot?" (settled: no) to "does the methodology outperform simpler approaches?" (open). The meta document captures this shift explicitly.
- **Formalism as type-checking**: Vic's final assessment — that the palgebra is "more like type-checking than quantum mechanics" — is a useful framing. It catches composition errors mechanically (the nesting example) but doesn't revolutionize practice for simple pipelines. Value scales with pipeline complexity.

## What Worked Well / What To Do Differently

- **Fresh run was better than extension**: The delta between two independent verdicts is more informative than an updated single verdict. This validates the methodology's own claim about repetition.
- **Review + remediation loop worked**: The initial deliberation converged too easily (premature unanimity, uncalibrated probabilities). The review caught this; the remediation addressed it. Post-remediation distribution is more defensible.
- **Meta document was the right output**: The deliberation record is process; the meta document is for readers. mg's editorial instinct to request the summary instead of a second review was correct.
