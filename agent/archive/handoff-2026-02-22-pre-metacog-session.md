# Session Handoff: 2026-02-22 (archived before metacog session)

This handoff was replaced by a new handoff after the metacog simplification and metacog-process-useful committee session. It captured the earlier 2026-02-22 work: repository review and run guide, CI/Condorcet deliberations, comparison protocol and runs, and wild-material verification.

**Use the current `agent/handoff-2026-02-22.md` for session continuity.** Full content of this archived handoff is in git history.
