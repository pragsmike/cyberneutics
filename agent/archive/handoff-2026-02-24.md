# Session Handoff: 2026-02-24 (Uptake chronology, Pask-mesh-bath split)

---

## Session Summary

**Duration**: Single session. Focus: meta/uptake documentation restructure, then wild/pask-mesh-bath split into framework + application documents.

**Original intent**: mg asked to (1) revise uptake-and-usage to note 2/23 two repo stars, split into a chronology (dated event log) and keep the original as current state + brief trajectory, and revise README Status; (2) later, read pask-mesh-bath, suggest a better name, create a README describing main ideas, and assess whether to split; (3) then do the split with suggested names; (4) finally do a handoff and write the commit message without committing.

**Actual outcome**: All of the above. Uptake docs split; README Status updated; pask-mesh-bath README added; document split into `bath-and-pask-meshes.md` (wild) and `glenda-crock-alignment.md` (applications/narrative-immune-systems); original `pask-mesh-bath.md` removed; both READMEs updated. Handoff written; commit message drafted below (not committed).

**Main Accomplishments**

1. **Uptake and usage restructure**
   - **meta/usage-and-uptake-chronology.md** (new): Dated event log (Feb 1 self-eval through Feb 23 repo stars), predicted-signals table, feedback log. Chronology last updated 2026-02-24.
   - **meta/uptake-and-usage.md** (revised): Now “current state + brief trajectory” only. Current state summarizes two forks, MOOLLM integration, two stars as of 2026-02-23, evidence so far. Trajectory in brief + link to chronology. Open questions for practitioners retained.
   - **README.md** Status section: Uptake summary added (two forks, MOOLLM, two stars as of 2026-02-23); links to [Uptake and usage](meta/uptake-and-usage.md) and [usage-and-uptake-chronology](meta/usage-and-uptake-chronology.md). Evidence-base paragraph lightly tightened.

2. **Wild pask-mesh-bath: README and split**
   - **wild/pask-mesh-bath/README.md** (new): Main ideas (bath + Pask meshes for document evaluation; Glenda/Crock as application), relationship, naming suggestions, connections. After split: updated to describe the two documents (bath-and-pask-meshes here, glenda-crock in applications) and removed “should you split” / naming-suggestion text.
   - **wild/pask-mesh-bath/bath-and-pask-meshes.md** (new): Full framework — Origin, Bath Problem, RDF Judgments, Pask Meshes, Discrepancy Taxonomy, Why RDF Insufficient, LLMs and Structural Comparison, Open Questions (bath/mesh only), Summary + link to Glenda/Crock doc.
   - **applications/narrative-immune-systems/glenda-crock-alignment.md** (new): “Builds on” pointer to bath-and-pask-meshes. Glenda/Crock Problem (seam, HIV strategy), Defensive Implications, Open Question (Crock as research object). Connections to bath doc, Essay 09, social-decision-disruption.
   - **wild/pask-mesh-bath/pask-mesh-bath.md** (deleted): Superseded by the two documents above.
   - **applications/narrative-immune-systems/README.md**: New Contents entry for Glenda/Crock with short description and link to bath doc.

**Files created**
- agent/handoff-2026-02-24.md (this file)
- meta/usage-and-uptake-chronology.md
- wild/pask-mesh-bath/README.md
- wild/pask-mesh-bath/bath-and-pask-meshes.md
- applications/narrative-immune-systems/glenda-crock-alignment.md

**Files modified**
- README.md (Status section)
- meta/uptake-and-usage.md (current state + trajectory; link to chronology)
- applications/narrative-immune-systems/README.md (Glenda/Crock in Contents)

**Files deleted**
- wild/pask-mesh-bath/pask-mesh-bath.md

## Mistakes and Lessons

- **StrReplace vs curly quotes**: Several edits to wild/pask-mesh-bath/README.md failed because the file used Unicode curly quotes (“ ”) and the search string used straight quotes. Worked around by doing smaller replacements (e.g. replace “**File 2:**” only) or by replacing substrings that didn’t include the quote character. Lesson: if replace fails on a short string that “should” match, check for smart/curly quotes in the file.
- **PowerShell**: `&&` is not a valid statement separator in this PowerShell version; use `;` for chained commands.

## Dead Ends Explored

## Current State

### Completed this session

| Item | Location / note |
|------|------------------|
| Uptake chronology | meta/usage-and-uptake-chronology.md (event log through 2026-02-23) |
| Uptake current state + trajectory | meta/uptake-and-usage.md |
| README Status | Links to both uptake docs; two stars as of 2/23 noted |
| Bath + Pask meshes (framework) | wild/pask-mesh-bath/bath-and-pask-meshes.md |
| Glenda/Crock (application) | applications/narrative-immune-systems/glenda-crock-alignment.md |
| Wild pask-mesh-bath README | Describes both docs and relationship |
| Narrative-immune-systems README | Glenda/Crock in Contents |

### In progress

- **Commit**: Commit message is written below; mg asked not to commit, only to write the message.

### Not started (from prior handoff)

- Commit from 2026-02-23 session (contributor experience) — may already be committed by mg.
- Ablation-study / evaluation-schemes execution, comparative evaluation, CI string-diagram job (all still pending mg’s decisions).

---

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Commit this session’s work** using the commit message below (or a variant). Stage new/edited/deleted files as appropriate.
2. If the 2026-02-23 commit wasn’t done yet, that’s a separate commit (contributor experience in research-programs).
3. Resume any planned work from prior handoff (ablation-study, comparative evaluation, CI) per mg’s priorities.

## Working with mg: Session-Specific Insights

- **Multi-step in one go**: mg gave a sequence (revise uptake → then README → then pask-mesh-bath README + split decision → then do split → then handoff + commit message). Executing the full sequence without stopping for approval at each step matched expectations.
- **Commit message but don’t commit**: Explicit “write the commit message but don’t commit” — same pattern as 2026-02-23; mg reviews before committing.

---

## Open Questions and Decisions Needed

- None raised this session. Prior handoff’s open questions (CI workflow, comparative evaluation decision, multi-model-committee-reference in CLAUDE.md) unchanged.

---

## Technical Notes

- **wild/pask-mesh-bath/**: If this directory was previously untracked (only pask-mesh-bath.md existed elsewhere), then the “deleted” file might show differently in git (e.g. as part of adding the new directory). Adjust staging so the commit reflects: new chronology, revised uptake, README Status; new bath-and-pask-meshes + README in wild; new glenda-crock-alignment in applications; updated applications README; removal of original single-file pask-mesh-bath doc.
- **Cross-references**: bath-and-pask-meshes.md links to ../../applications/narrative-immune-systems/glenda-crock-alignment.md. glenda-crock-alignment.md links to ../../wild/pask-mesh-bath/bath-and-pask-meshes.md and to social-decision-disruption.md. All relative paths assume repo root layout.

---

## Watch-Outs for Successor

- **Uptake chronology**: When adding new events, add a dated entry to usage-and-uptake-chronology.md and update “Chronology last updated” at the bottom. Keep uptake-and-usage.md as the short “current state + trajectory” summary.
- **Bath vs Glenda/Crock**: Document-evaluation framework lives in wild; alignment application lives in applications/narrative-immune-systems. Don’t merge them back into one file without good reason; the split serves different citation and audience needs.
