# Session Handoff: 2026-02-16 (Session B)

## Session Summary

**Duration**: Extended session (continuation after context compaction)
**Main Accomplishments**:
- **Completed full repo review and synthesis plan**: Read every file in the repository. Wrote an 11-item plan (`agent/archive/cross-reference-synthesis-plan.md`) identifying disconnected material, missing cross-references, and audience path problems.
- **Executed all 11 plan items**: Modified 16 files across the repository to cross-reference, surface hidden material, fix broken links, triage stale "coming soon" lists, and improve navigation for all audience types.
- **Reorganized maintenance artifacts**: Moved `gap_analysis.md` from `artifacts/` to `agent/` (it's a repo-maintenance artifact, not a user-facing technique). Archived the executed plan with front matter.

**Original Intent**: "Read everything in the repo. Look for opportunities to cross-reference and synthesize. What could be made clearer? How could we offer better paths to the intended audiences? Look for the committee debate transcripts."
**Actual Outcome**: Comprehensive cross-referencing completed. Every essay now has related-material footers. Hidden material (scene-1.md transcript, stochastic imps origin story) connected to indexes. Broken links fixed. Coming-soon debt triaged honestly. Palgebra formalism connected to the artifacts that embody it.

## Mistakes and Lessons

### Context compaction mid-task
The session hit context limits while reading files for the repo review. Required continuation from a summary. The summary was comprehensive enough that no significant context was lost, but the lesson is: on a read-everything task, read efficiently and start writing the plan sooner rather than reading every last file first.

### Broken links hiding in plain sight
`essays/README.md` had links to `pachinko-of-stored-literature.md` and `charts-on-a-manifold.md` that looked like normal links but the files don't exist. They weren't marked "coming soon" — they appeared as if the files existed. The gap_analysis.md didn't catch these as dangling links either (its "Dangling Links" section said "None"). Lesson: check that linked files actually exist, don't trust the gap analysis document at face value.

### Edit tool context invalidation
Confirmed the pattern from the previous handoff: the Edit tool requires a Read in the current context. After context compaction, all previous Reads are invalid. Always re-Read before Edit.

## Dead Ends Explored

None. The plan-then-execute approach worked cleanly. Each of the 11 items was straightforward once the plan was written.

## Current State

### Completed This Session

**Top-level README.md**:
- Added Skeptic audience with link to curated reading path
- Added link to essays/README reading paths (Practitioner/Theorist/Skeptic)
- Made Quick Start Guide the first link under "Want practical techniques?"
- Added Evidence base paragraph to Status section

**Cross-references added** (6 essays that previously had no related-material footers):
- `essays/04-cybernetics-and-observation.md` — related artifacts + essays
- `essays/05-the-synthesis.md` — related artifacts including palgebra
- `essays/stories-all-the-way-down.md` — related essays + artifacts
- `essays/narrative-computing-history.md` — related essays + artifacts
- `essays/societies-of-thought-synthesis.md` — related artifacts
- `essays/the-stochastic-imps-of-happenstance.md` — related materials footer

**Character origins connected**:
- `artifacts/character-propensity-reference.md` — added "Character origins" note linking to stochastic imps essay
- `essays/the-stochastic-imps-of-happenstance.md` — added footer linking to character reference, adversarial committees, quick start

**scene-1.md connected**:
- `essays/README.md` — new "Transcripts and Worked Examples" section
- `artifacts/examples/README.md` — added to completed files

**Coming-soon triage**:
- `essays/README.md` — fixed 2 broken links (pachinko, charts) → marked "coming soon" with preview notes; added "(Meanwhile: ...)" cross-references to 4 applied essays pointing to existing artifact counterparts
- `agent/gap_analysis.md` (moved from artifacts/) — reorganized into 3 tiers, removed stale entries

**Palgebra connections**:
- `palgebra/decorated-texts.md` — new "Connections to practice" section mapping formalism to artifacts

**Working document header**:
- `essays/concept-extraction-stochastic-imps.md` — added "Working document" note

**References directory**:
- `references/README.md` — linked to full bibliography, linked each source to its introductory essay, added Fong & Spivak

**File moves**:
- `artifacts/gap_analysis.md` → `agent/gap_analysis.md`
- `agent/cross-reference-synthesis-plan.md` → `agent/archive/cross-reference-synthesis-plan.md` (with executed front matter)

### In Progress
- None. Clean stopping point. Ready for commit.

### Not Yet Started
- **Commit**: All changes staged and ready. Previous session's git identity issue may still apply — mg needs to configure `user.email` and `user.name`.
- Items carried from previous handoff: test enriched committee skill, consider independent evaluation skill, more examples.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Commit these changes**: Everything is ready. The commit covers two logical units of work (this session's cross-referencing + the previous session's palgebra/skill/documentation work). Could be one commit or two — mg's call.

2. **Test enriched committee skill** (carried over): Run `/committee` on a real problem. The calibration pairs and interaction dynamics added last session haven't been tested yet.

3. **Consider writing one of the "no existing coverage" essays**: The gap analysis now clearly separates "coming soon" essays into three tiers. The "no existing coverage" tier (when-methodology-fails, formalization-problem, cognitive-overhead) has no corresponding artifacts. These would add genuine new value vs. the "corresponding artifacts exist" tier where the essays would formalize what's already documented practically.

## Working with mg: Session-Specific Insights

### Communication
- **Compound instructions work**: mg gave a multi-part request ("Add front matter... move it... is gap_analysis relevant?... should it be in agent?... anything else?") and expected all parts addressed in a single response. No need to break these into separate interactions.
- **Agrees quickly with good reasoning**: When presented with "gap_analysis belongs in agent/, not artifacts/" mg agreed immediately. mg values structural correctness and responds well to clear rationale for organizational decisions.
- **Asks open-ended quality checks**: "Anything else before we commit?" signals trust in the agent's judgment to surface issues proactively. Rise to this — check for broken links, stale references, etc.

### Previous handoff observations validated
- **Decisive and directive**: Confirmed again. "Execute that plan, in priority order as you listed." — direct instruction, clear expectation.
- **Completionist**: Confirmed. mg wanted all 11 items executed, not a subset.
- **README length concern**: The README is now longer with the Evidence base paragraph. Previous handoff flagged it was getting long. Still within reason, but additional sections should be sub-paged.

## Open Questions

1. **Should the handoff file from earlier today be archived?** The current state has `agent/handoff-2026-02-16.md` (from earlier) and this file. The earlier one is now stale — this one supersedes it. But they have the same date. I've named this one `handoff-2026-02-16-b.md` to disambiguate.

2. **Git identity**: Previous session hit `Author identity unknown` error. mg may need to configure git before committing.

## Technical Notes

- **agent/ directory now contains**: `handoff-2026-02-16.md` (earlier session), `handoff-2026-02-16-b.md` (this session), `gap_analysis.md` (moved from artifacts/), `README.md`, `archive/` directory
- **agent/archive/ now contains**: `handoff-2026-02-01.md`, `cross-reference-synthesis-plan.md`
- **No broken links from file moves**: Verified that nothing in live documentation links to `artifacts/gap_analysis.md`. Only references are in archived handoffs and `task.md` (historical).

## Watch-Outs for Successor

- **The "coming soon" entries in essays/README.md still have dead links for eigenforms and editor-role**: `[Eigenforms and Narrative Convergence](./eigenforms-narrative-convergence.md)` and `[The Editor's Role](./editor-role-publishing.md)` are marked "coming soon" but still have hyperlinks to non-existent files. I fixed the pachinko and charts links (removed the hyperlinks, kept as plain text) but left eigenforms and editor-role as-is since they're clearly marked "coming soon". Consistent treatment would be to remove the hyperlinks from these too — just didn't want to make a judgment call on whether mg prefers the link as a placeholder.

- **Cross-reference footers vary in format**: Some essays end with `**Related artifacts**:` / `**Related essays**:`, others with `## Further Reading`, others with `---` + navigation text. I matched the local style of each file rather than imposing uniform formatting. A future pass could standardize if desired.

- **The gap_analysis is a living document**: Now that it's in `agent/`, it should be updated when new essays/examples are written. It's essentially a backlog. Consider whether `task.md` (which exists at repo root) makes it redundant.

## What Worked Well / What To Do Differently

### Worked well
- **Plan-then-execute**: Writing the full 11-item plan before touching any files produced clean, systematic edits. No backtracking.
- **Parallel reads**: Reading multiple files simultaneously (the `Read` tool supports concurrent calls) significantly sped up the repo review phase.
- **Priority ordering**: Executing highest-impact items first meant that even if the session had been cut short, the most valuable changes would have been in place.

### Do differently
- **Read more efficiently on first pass**: Spent time reading files I'd already read in the pre-compaction context. A successor inheriting a context summary should trust the summary's file descriptions and only re-read files they need to edit.
