# Session Handoff: 2026-02-22 (Editorial Review, Documentation, Research-Programs Collection)

**Note:** Earlier 2026-02-22 sessions archived:
- `agent/archive/handoff-2026-02-22-condorcet.md` — condorcet contributor session
- `agent/archive/handoff-2026-02-22-wild-verification.md` — wild-material-incorporation verification
- `agent/archive/handoff-2026-02-22-pr-review.md` — PR review and documentation update (superseded by this handoff)

## Session Summary

**Duration**: Single session. Work focused on editorial consistency, documentation completeness, and consolidating research plans.

**Main Accomplishments**:
- **Editorial review**: Ran full editorial review per `agent/prompts/editorial-review.md` across numbered essays 01–11 and supporting essays. Produced `agent/editorial-review-report.md` with per-essay notes, cross-cutting issues (character attributions, terminology, reading paths), and prioritized recommendations.
- **Editorial fixes implemented**: Applied high/medium/low-priority fixes from the report: character propensity corrections (Joe "pragmatic" → "continuity guardian" in essays 07, 08; Maya "Experience" → "Paranoid realism" in essay 11); Theorist path note in `essays/README.md`; roster names in essay 02; eigenform verbal gloss in essay 04; Robert's Rules link text in essay 07. Optional Essay 07 section compression (2c) not done.
- **README and essays link completeness**: Ensured top-level README and `essays/README.md` list all essays; added missing `tilt-sound-collective-story.md` to both and to essays Supplementary section.
- **Skills enumeration**: Confirmed all six slash-command skills (committee, scenarios, probe, review, string-diagram, handoff); updated top-level README Agent Skills table and follow-up sentence to include `/scenarios` and `/probe`; added pointer in `artifacts/quick-start-guide.md` to other skills and run guide.
- **Research-programs collection (Option B)**: Created `meta/research-programs/` and moved/consolidated plans: `meta/research-plan.md` → `meta/research-programs/societies-of-thought-research-plan.md`; moved `agent/evaluation-schemes-analysis.md` → `meta/research-programs/evaluation-schemes.md`; moved `agent/multi-model-committee-analysis.md` → `meta/research-programs/multi-model-committee.md`. Added `meta/research-programs/README.md` with index ordered by impact on uncertainty, active vs completed plans, and by-theme table. Added redirect at `meta/research-plan.md`; updated `meta/README.md`, `essays/societies-of-thought-synthesis.md`, `agent/gap_analysis.md`, `meta/methodology-evolution.md`, `references/README.md`, handoffs, and diary to new paths.
- **Commits**: (1) "Document all six agent skills in README and quick-start; add editorial review report" — README, quick-start-guide, agent/editorial-review-report.md. (2) "Collect research plans under meta/research-programs with README index" — research-programs directory, moves, redirect, reference updates.

**Original intent**: Editorial review → fixes → README/essays links → skills list → research-programs collection (plan then Option B) → commits → handoff.

**Actual outcome**: All completed. No blocked items.

## Mistakes and Lessons

- **PowerShell vs bash**: `&&` is not valid in PowerShell; use `;` for command chaining. Git commands succeeded after switching to `;`.
- **Replace vs table**: One `StrReplace` on a markdown table row in an archive handoff failed (likely pipe/whitespace); the same file had already been updated via a different replace. When editing tables, ensure exact string match including pipes and spaces.

## Current State

### Completed This Session

| Item | Location / note |
|------|------------------|
| Editorial review report | `agent/editorial-review-report.md` |
| Character propensity fixes | Essays 07, 08, 11; roster-aligned |
| Theorist path note | `essays/README.md` — 07 and 09 discoverable |
| Essay 02 roster names | Maya, Vic, Frankie, Joe, Tammy |
| Essay 04 eigenform gloss | Verbal gloss for recurrence equation |
| Essay 07 link text | "Forcing Functions" (plural) |
| Top-level README essays list | All 18 essays, ordered 01–11 then named |
| Essays README | tilt-sound-collective-story in Supplementary |
| README Agent Skills | All six skills in table + sentence |
| Quick-start guide | Pointer to other skills + run guide |
| meta/research-programs/ | README index, societies-of-thought-research-plan, evaluation-schemes, ablation-study, multi-model-committee |
| meta/research-plan.md | Redirect to research-programs/ |
| Reference updates | societies-of-thought-synthesis, meta/README, gap_analysis, methodology-evolution, references/README, handoffs, diary |

### Outstanding Optional Items (carried from previous handoff)

1. **CI workflow**: GitHub Actions for `scripts/test_string_diagram.py` — not implemented; mg has not decided.
2. **Comparative evaluation**: One decision, three methods (committee, pros/cons, single LLM), same rubric. Requires mg to choose a decision.
3. **gap_analysis.md closure**: Update per wild-material-incorporation Part 5 (Essay 11, residuality, TODOs). Low priority.

### Programs in meta/research-programs/

- **societies-of-thought-research-plan.md** — Ten action items, four phases (infrastructure, generalization, theory, evidence, MOOLLM).
- **evaluation-schemes.md** — Research design for empirical comparison (no ground truth required).
- **multi-model-committee.md** — Different LLMs per character; architectures and protocol.

All linked from `meta/research-programs/README.md` with impact-on-uncertainty ordering. Ablation study (Design F) has its own plan at ablation-study.md and results folder. Completed plans (wild-material-incorporation, cross-reference-synthesis, augmentation) remain in `agent/archive/` and are linked from the README.

### Carried Forward

- `/probe` still untested; `/review` on methodology-adoption (scenario-aware) not run.
- Roster customization workflow undocumented.

---

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Comparative evaluation** (highest value): Run one decision through three methods with same rubric. Requires mg to choose a decision.
2. **If mg approves**: Execute evaluation-schemes and/or multi-model-committee plans (both in `meta/research-programs/`).
3. **Optional paperwork**: Update `agent/gap_analysis.md` per wild-material-incorporation Part 5.
4. **If testing**: Run `/probe`; run `/review` on methodology-adoption with scenario context.

## Working with mg: Session-Specific Insights

- **Plan then execute**: mg used Plan mode for research-programs organization, then said "B, move the material" to approve Option B. Clear sequence: propose structure, get direction, implement.
- **Commit when asked**: mg said "Commit this" after the research-programs work; single explicit instruction, no intermediate confirmations.
- **Handoff on request**: `/handoff` invoked at end of session; skill ran without asking for confirmation. Archive previous same-day handoff with a descriptive suffix (`-pr-review`) so the active handoff reflects the latest session.

---

## Open Questions and Decisions Needed

- **CI workflow**: Add string-diagram test job or defer?
- **Comparative evaluation**: Which decision for the three-method run?
- **Evaluation-schemes / multi-model-committee**: Execute one or both? Plans are in `meta/research-programs/`.

---

## Technical Notes

- **agent/gap_analysis.md** stays in agent/ (CLAUDE.md and when-methodology-fails reference it). Research-plans README links to it for "planned docs and TODOs."
- **Research plan links**: All references to `meta/research-plan.md` or the old agent analysis paths now point to `meta/research-programs/` or specific files there. If you add new docs that cite "the research plan," use `meta/research-programs/societies-of-thought-research-plan.md` or `meta/research-programs/README.md` as appropriate.

---

## Watch-Outs for Successor

- **Don't redo editorial fixes**: Character labels (Joe, Maya) and Theorist path note are done. Optional Essay 07 compression (II.D, III.A) was explicitly skipped.
- **Research plans live in meta/research-programs/**: Do not look for evaluation-schemes or multi-model-committee in `agent/`; they were moved. Redirect at `meta/research-plan.md` points to the collection.
- **Four handoffs for 2026-02-22**: condorcet, wild-verification, pr-review (archived), and this one (active). Use this file for continuity.
