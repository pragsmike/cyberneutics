# Ready for Maintainer Review (2026-02-22)

One-page checklist for mg (or any maintainer) picking up after the 2026-02-22 session. Full context: **`agent/handoff-2026-02-22.md`**.

**Note (2026-02-24):** The comparison and deliberation records referenced below were moved to `meta/research-programs/condorcet-comparison/results/`. See [meta/research-programs/condorcet-comparison.md](../../meta/research-programs/condorcet-comparison.md).

## What was done

- **Review & runbook:** `meta/repository-review-and-run-guide.md` — how to run and test the repo; references the smoke test.
- **Smoke test:** `scripts/test_string_diagram.py` — run from repo root: `python scripts/test_string_diagram.py` (expect three OK lines).
- **CI deliberation:** Committee recommended adding a CI job for the smoke test, with documented scope. **Not implemented** — maintainer to add workflow if desired. Record: `agent/deliberations/ci-string-diagram-test/`.
- **Condorcet:** Committee recommended documenting (not "correcting for") Condorcet's jury theorem. **Artifact added:** `artifacts/condorcet-jury-theorem-and-committee.md`. Deliberation: `agent/deliberations/condorcet-jury-theorem-process/`.
- **Comparison protocol:** `artifacts/comparison-protocol-deliberative-vs-cjt.md` — how to run deliberative vs. CJT-style (independent vote) on the same question.
- **Two comparison runs:** `agent/comparisons/second-ci-job/` (same verdict: Nay), `agent/comparisons/code-of-conduct/` (**opposite verdicts:** CJT Aye 3–2, Deliberative Nay 5–0). Summaries in each `04-comparison-summary.md`.

## Maintainer checklist

- [ ] Read **`agent/handoff-2026-02-22.md`**.
- [ ] Run **`python scripts/test_string_diagram.py`** (from repo root); expect three OK lines.
- [ ] Skim **`artifacts/condorcet-jury-theorem-and-committee.md`** and **`agent/comparisons/code-of-conduct/04-comparison-summary.md`**.
- [ ] Decide whether to **add the CI workflow** (committee recommended it; see `agent/deliberations/ci-string-diagram-test/03-resolution.md`).
- [ ] **Commit** when satisfied. New/modified paths: `meta/`, `scripts/`, `artifacts/` (Condorcet doc, comparison protocol, adversarial-committees link), `agent/deliberations/` (ci-string-diagram-test, condorcet-jury-theorem-process, second-ci-job, code-of-conduct), `agent/comparisons/` (README, second-ci-job, code-of-conduct), `agent/handoff-2026-02-22.md`, `agent/ready-for-maintainer-review.md`. Previous handoff archived to `agent/archive/handoff-2026-02-21.md`.

## Optional follow-ups (from handoff)

- Add **when-methodology-fails.md** to quick-start recommended reading.
- Run **comparative evaluation** (one decision, three methods, same rubric) — committee’s #1 evidence gap; this session did two deliberative-vs-CJT comparisons instead.
- Add a **CI workflow** that runs `scripts/test_string_diagram.py` and documents scope (see resolution in ci-string-diagram-test).
