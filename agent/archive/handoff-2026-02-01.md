# Session Handoff: 2026-02-01

## Session Summary

**Duration**: High-velocity documentation session (~2 hours)
**Main Accomplishments**:
- **Completed Theory Core**: Wrote Essays 04 (Cybernetics), 05 (Synthesis), and 06 (Deleuze), completing the theoretical foundations.
- **Completed Core Artifacts**: Created `troubleshooting.md` and `integration-with-moollm.md`.
- **Infrastructure**: Added `CONTRIBUTING.md`, created `task.md` for tracking, and refactored `Makefile`.
- **Verification**: Performed security scan (clean) and validated `hiring-decision-example.md` (exists and is high quality).

**Original Intent**: "Refactoring Makefile" and checking repo status.
**Actual Outcome**: We achieved "V1.0 Readiness" for the documentation. All core essays and artifacts listed in the original gap analysis are done.

## Mistakes and Lessons

### Mistake 1: Tool Call Precision
**What happened**: I failed several `task_boundary` and `write_to_file` calls due to argument schema errors (e.g., trying to write "artifacts" to paths that weren't in the artifact directory, or providing empty arguments).
**Root cause**: Model confusion between "Artifacts" (the concept in this repo) and "Artifacts" (the tool capability).
**How to avoid**: Be precise. `write_to_file` treats `IsArtifact: true` as a trigger for side effects. In this repo, most "artifacts" are just markdown files in `artifacts/`. Use `IsArtifact: false` unless you are explicitly using the agentic artifact system.

### Mistake 2: Missing the Existing Example
**What happened**: I listed `hiring-decision-example.md` as a "Next Step" in `gap_analysis.md` updates, thinking it was missing or partial.
**Root cause**: I hadn't checked `artifacts/examples/` thoroughly.
**Actual status**: It exists and is excellent.
**How to avoid**: Always `ls -R` or `find` before declaring something missing.

## Current State

### Completed This Session
- **Essays**:
    - `06-deleuze-difference-repetition.md` (Deleuzian metaphysics of AI)
    - `05-the-synthesis.md` (The Grand Unified Theory)
    - `04-cybernetics-and-observation.md` (The physics of the feedback loop)
- **Artifacts**:
    - `integration-with-moollm.md` (Architecture patterns)
    - `troubleshooting.md` (Diagnosis/Fix patterns)
- **Repo Ops**:
    - `CONTRIBUTING.md`
    - `Makefile` (variable-ized)
    - `task.md` (all items checked off)

### In Progress
- None. Clean stopping point.

### Not Yet Started (But Planned/Supplementary)
- **Supplementary Essays**: `narrative-computing-history.md`, `pachinko-of-stored-literature.md`, etc. (Low priority, nice-to-have).
- **More Examples**: `strategic-pivot-example.md`, `failure-case-example.md`. (High priority).

## Immediate Next Steps

1.  **Generate More Examples** (`artifacts/examples/`)
    - We have one great example (`hiring-decision`).
    - The methodology needs a *diverse* set of examples to prove it's not just for hiring.
    - **Strategic Pivot**: A high-level business strategy debate.
    - **Failure Case**: An example where the committee fails (to illustrate `troubleshooting.md` points).

2.  **Validate `Makefile`**
    - usage: `make pack`.
    - We refactored it but didn't execute/verify the output file content during this session.
    - Useful to confirm it actually produces the `cybersense-pack.txt` correctly.

3.  **Supplementary Essays**
    - Only if mg wants to dive deeper into History or Category Theory (`charts-on-a-manifold.md`).

## Working with mg: Session-Specific Insights

### Communication
- **Direct & Efficient**: mg gives short, clear confirmations ("yes", "Write that essay").
- **Theory-Driven**: mg cares deeply about the "Why". They explicitly asked for the Deleuze and Synthesis essays to be rigorous.
- **Completionist**: We successfully finished a checklist. mg likes seeing the "Gap Analysis" shrink to zero.

### Quality Standards
- **Integrative**: Essays shouldn't just stand alone; they should cross-reference (e.g., Essay 04 referencing Essay 06).
- **Concrete**: Even theoretical essays use engineering metaphors (control theory, gain, feedback loops).

## Open Questions

1.  **Evolution of MOOLLM Integration**:
    - `integration-with-moollm.md` is theoretical. As MOOLLM code matures, this document will need to be updated with actual code samples (Cards, Rooms).

## Technical Notes

- **`task.md`** is the source of truth for current session progress.
- **`artifacts/gap_analysis.md`** is the backlog.
- **`Makefile`** has `OUTPUT_FILE` and `INCLUDE_PATTERNS` variables now, making it easier to customize the "pack" for different contexts (e.g., "just essays").
