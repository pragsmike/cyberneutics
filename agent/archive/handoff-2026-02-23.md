# Session Handoff: 2026-02-23 (Contributor Experience Improvements)

**Note:** This handoff supersedes the previous 2026-02-23 handoff (archived as `agent/archive/handoff-2026-02-23.md`) which covered the research-programs restructure and condorcet consolidation. This session built directly on that work — the previous handoff's "optional" Status header task became the first step of this session's larger contributor-experience improvement.

---

## Session Summary

**Duration**: Single session. Focus: evaluate and improve the contributor experience in `meta/research-programs/`, implementing all four recommendations from a committee deliberation.

**Original intent**: mg asked for a `/committee` deliberation on the experience of a researcher looking to contribute by inspecting the research-programs directory, then asked to implement all recommendations including splitting large documents.

**Actual outcome**: All four recommendations implemented. The committee deliberation produced the analysis; the implementation session executed it fully.

**Main Accomplishments**

1. **Committee deliberation** on contributor experience (`agent/deliberations/contributor-experience-research-programs/`, files 00–03). Identified four friction points: missing triage metadata, no curated entry points, unstated prerequisites, and 12x variance in plan length. Produced four concrete recommendations ordered by cost.

2. **Applied Status/Runs/Results headers** to the three plans that lacked them:
   - `societies-of-thought-research-plan.md`: Status: Active, Runs: (none yet), Results: (individual action items)
   - `evaluation-schemes.md`: Status: Active (umbrella), Runs: links to ablation + condorcet, Results: per-design
   - `multi-model-committee.md`: Status: Active (not started), Runs: (none yet), Results: (create folder when Phase 1 begins)

3. **Added Contributing metadata blocks** to all five plan files. Each has a blockquote with: Skills needed, Estimated scope, Contributor type, Entry point. Tailored to each plan's specifics (e.g., ablation-study says "familiarity with committee pipeline, basic statistics" while multi-model-committee says "API access to 2+ LLM providers").

4. **Added Quick Start for Contributors section** to `meta/research-programs/README.md`, placed above the Conventions section. Contains a prerequisites line pointing to `artifacts/adversarial-committees.md`, a 5-row intent-based table ("I want to... → Start here → Scope"), and a note that every plan has a Contributing block.

5. **Split `multi-model-committee.md`** from a 1,730-line monograph into:
   - `multi-model-committee.md` (246 lines): Clean experimental plan — Status header, Contributing block, objective, 4-phase protocol, evaluation framework summary, risks table, recommendations, conclusion, links to reference.
   - `multi-model-committee-reference.md` (1,417 lines): All architectural patterns (5), model personality profiles (5 models), implementation architecture (orchestrator code, API abstraction, context management, error handling), cost analysis, open questions (13), connections to existing work (MOOLLM, debate literature, residuality theory, Pask), production checklist, full implementation template with Python code and YAML config.

6. **Updated README tables**: Priority table and Active programs table both reflect the split (link to plan + reference).

**Files created (7):**
- `agent/deliberations/contributor-experience-research-programs/00-charter.md`
- `agent/deliberations/contributor-experience-research-programs/01-roster.md`
- `agent/deliberations/contributor-experience-research-programs/01-convening.md`
- `agent/deliberations/contributor-experience-research-programs/02-deliberation.md`
- `agent/deliberations/contributor-experience-research-programs/03-resolution.md`
- `meta/research-programs/multi-model-committee-reference.md`
- This handoff

**Files modified (6):**
- `meta/research-programs/README.md` (Quick Start section, table updates)
- `meta/research-programs/societies-of-thought-research-plan.md` (Status header + Contributing block)
- `meta/research-programs/evaluation-schemes.md` (Status header + Contributing block)
- `meta/research-programs/ablation-study.md` (Contributing block)
- `meta/research-programs/condorcet-comparison.md` (Contributing block)
- `meta/research-programs/multi-model-committee.md` (rewritten: 1,730 → 246 lines)

**Files archived (1):**
- `agent/archive/handoff-2026-02-23.md` (previous handoff covering restructure + condorcet)

## Mistakes and Lessons

- **No significant mistakes this session.** The committee deliberation was clean, and the implementation followed it directly.
- **Edit tool requires prior Read**: Attempted to edit `condorcet-comparison.md` without reading it first in this tool session; got a tool error. Always Read before Edit, even if you read the file earlier via a different tool invocation.

---

## Dead Ends Explored

None. The committee deliberation converged quickly on a layered approach, and implementation was straightforward.

## Current State

### Completed

| Item | Location / note |
|------|------------------|
| Committee deliberation on contributor experience | `agent/deliberations/contributor-experience-research-programs/` (00–03) |
| Status/Runs/Results headers on all five plans | All five plan files now have the standard header |
| Contributing metadata blocks on all five plans | Skills, Scope, Type, Entry point in each |
| Quick Start for Contributors in README | Above Conventions section; 5-row intent table + prerequisites |
| Multi-model-committee split | Plan (246 lines) + Reference (1,417 lines) |
| README tables updated for split | Priority table and Active programs table reference both files |

### Previous session's "optional" items — now resolved

- **Status headers on three plans**: Done (was listed as optional in previous handoff).
- **Empty agent dirs**: Still present; still harmless. Filesystem permissions prevent deletion.

### Programs in meta/research-programs/

| Program | Status | Results | New this session |
|---------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| societies-of-thought-research-plan | Active | — | Status header + Contributing block |
| evaluation-schemes | Umbrella (Designs A–F) | Phase 1 = ablation-study | Status header + Contributing block |
| ablation-study | Not started | ablation-study/results/ | Contributing block |
| condorcet-comparison | Completed (2 runs) | condorcet-comparison/results/ | Contributing block |
| multi-model-committee | Active (not started) | — | Split into plan + reference; Status header + Contributing block |

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Commit**: mg was given a commit message but hasn't committed yet. The commit message is ready; all files are staged-ready.
2. **Execute ablation-study or other evaluation-schemes phases** (from prior handoff): Still pending mg's decision.
3. **Comparative evaluation** (from prior handoff): One decision, three methods, same rubric — still pending mg's choice of decision.
4. **CI workflow** (from prior handoff): String-diagram test job — add or defer?
5. **Monitor contributor metadata freshness**: If plan statuses change, the Contributing blocks and Quick Start table need updating. Current state is accurate as of this session.

## Working with mg: Session-Specific Insights

- **Committee → implement flow**: mg asked for a committee deliberation first, reviewed the output (the decision space summary), then said "Implement all the recommendations, splitting large documents where it helps." This is the deliberated-choice pattern applied to the project's own development — fan (explore options) → funnel (pick and execute).
- **"Splitting large documents where it helps"**: mg didn't just accept the recommendations — they expanded the scope by explicitly approving the multi-model-committee split that the committee had flagged as "requires authorial judgment." This suggests mg is comfortable with structural changes when justified by analysis.
- **Commit message review**: mg asked to see the commit message without committing. This is the pattern from prior sessions — mg reviews before committing. Don't auto-commit.
- **Brief confirmations**: When asked "is it done?" mg wanted a concise yes/tally, not a re-explanation. Keep completion reports short.

---

## Open Questions and Decisions Needed

- CI workflow (string-diagram test job): add or defer?
- Comparative evaluation: which decision for the three-method run?
- Execute ablation-study and/or multi-model-committee Phase 1 next?
- Should `multi-model-committee-reference.md` be referenced from CLAUDE.md or other repo-level docs? Currently only linked from the plan file and the README.

---

## Technical Notes

- **multi-model-committee-reference.md** is new and not yet referenced from CLAUDE.md or the repo map. It's linked from multi-model-committee.md (the plan) and from the research-programs README tables. If someone searches for "model personality profiles" or "implementation template" they'll need to know to look there.
- **Contributing blocks use blockquote syntax** (`> **Contributing...**`). This renders as a visually distinct callout in GitHub-flavored Markdown. All five plans use the same format for consistency.
- **The Quick Start table** in the README uses "I want to..." phrasing. If new programs are added, add a row to this table. Keep it to 5-7 rows max.
- **Previous handoff archived**: The previous 2026-02-23 handoff (restructure + condorcet) is now at `agent/archive/handoff-2026-02-23.md`. This is unusual — same date, different session. The archive file covers the earlier session; this file covers the later one.

---

## Watch-Outs for Successor

- **Don't duplicate the Contributing block format**: All five plans use the same blockquote structure. If adding a new plan, copy the format from `ablation-study.md` (cleanest example) and customize the content.
- **The multi-model-committee split created cross-references**: The plan links to the reference doc multiple times using section anchors (e.g., `multi-model-committee-reference.md#the-hypothesis-why-model-diversity-matters`). If you restructure the reference doc's headings, those anchors will break.
- **README Quick Start table scope estimates**: These are rough. "Month" for ablation-study means "design + execution including rater recruitment." An individual contributor running a single ablation condition might finish in a week. Don't over-promise precision.
- **evaluation-schemes.md now has TWO Status lines**: One at the top (the new standard header) and one at the bottom (the original "Status: Ready for implementation"). Both are accurate but serve different purposes. The top one is for triage; the bottom one is the document's own conclusion. Don't remove either without understanding context.

## Context for Specific Files

| File | Note |
|------|------|
| `meta/research-programs/README.md` | Now has Quick Start section above Conventions. Priority table and Active table reference multi-model-committee-reference.md. |
| `meta/research-programs/multi-model-committee.md` | Rewritten from 1,730 → 246 lines. Is now a clean experimental plan. All architectural/implementation detail moved to reference. |
| `meta/research-programs/multi-model-committee-reference.md` | New file. Contains everything that was in old multi-model-committee.md except the experimental protocol, risks, recommendations, and conclusion. |
| `agent/deliberations/contributor-experience-research-programs/` | Committee deliberation record. Resolution passed 5-0. Key insight: the directory served two audiences (maintainer + contributor) through one artifact; the layered approach addresses this without full separation. |
