# Session Handoff: 2026-02-21 (fifth session)

## Session Summary

**Duration**: Single session. Continues from the fourth session (archived as `agent/archive/handoff-2026-02-21-e.md`) which delivered when-methodology-fails and its committee evaluation. This session completed two more of the four robust actions from the methodology-adoption-strategy committee and fixed README link gaps.

**Main Accomplishments**:
- **README link fixes.** Identified references that were plain text but had corresponding files: essays (04 cybernetics-and-observation, 05 the-synthesis), artifacts (roberts-rules-forcing-function, independent-evaluation), references (Dervin, Second-Order Cybernetics, Deleuzian philosophy → references/README.md#sense-making, #cybernetics, #philosophy). All fixed.
- **Start Here reading path (robust action 1).** Created `artifacts/start-here.md`: ~15-min onboarding (gist → read 01, 02, 03 → try quick-start or adversarial-committees → what next). Linked from top-level README "Getting started" as the lead entry.
- **Full-pipeline worked example (robust action 2).** Created `artifacts/examples/full-pipeline-worked-example.md`: documents the methodology-adoption-strategy run (situation → scenarios → charter → deliberation → resolution) with table of artifact locations and honest commentary (scenario context changing deliberation, self-applying worked-example idea, key assumption made explicit, evidence limits, resilience vs single-future bet). Linked from `artifacts/examples/README.md`.
- **gap_analysis.md.** Added both items as TODOs with source (methodology-adoption-strategy), then marked both done with brief completion notes.

**Original intent**: User asked to add robust actions 1 and 2 as TODOs in gap_analysis, create a plan to do 1 and 2, and do it.

**Actual outcome**: Full execution. TODOs added, Start Here and full-pipeline worked example created and integrated. Of the four robust actions, three are now done (when-methodology-fails, Start Here, worked example). Remaining: monitoring infrastructure (GitHub analytics, citation alerts, quarterly uptake).

## Mistakes and Lessons

- **No execution mistakes.** Work was straightforward: link fixes from README + file existence check; Start Here and worked example written to the resolution’s spec.
- **Lesson**: The full-pipeline example benefited from reading the actual scenario and deliberation files (00-situation, 02-scenarios, 02-deliberation, 03-resolution) so the commentary could cite specific moves (Maya’s political framing, Joe’s "this deliberation is the worked example," Tammy’s feedback loops) rather than generic summary.

## Dead Ends Explored

None.

## Current State

### Completed This Session

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| `README.md` | **Modified.** Unlinked references → links (essays 04/05, artifacts roberts-rules/independent-evaluation, references sections). "Getting started" leads with Start Here. |
| `agent/gap_analysis.md` | **Modified.** Start Here and Full-pipeline worked example added as TODOs, then marked done with completion notes. |
| `artifacts/start-here.md` | **New.** 15-min path: gist, read (01, 02, 03), try (quick-start / adversarial-committees), what next. |
| `artifacts/examples/full-pipeline-worked-example.md` | **New.** Pipeline table, situation/scenarios/committee/resolution summary, honest commentary. |
| `artifacts/examples/README.md` | **Modified.** full-pipeline-worked-example.md added to Completed Files. |
| `agent/archive/handoff-2026-02-21-e.md` | **New.** Archived fourth session handoff. |

### In Progress

- **Nothing**; all planned work this session is complete.

### Carried Forward (from previous handoffs, still relevant)

- **Quickstart guide update**: Committee (when-methodology-fails-evaluation) recommended referencing when-methodology-fails.md as recommended reading before first committee use. Not yet done.
- **Remaining robust action**: Monitoring infrastructure (monthly GitHub analytics, quarterly uptake review, citation alerts). Q2 2026.
- **Remediation flow test**: is-author-crackpot (sum 11 < 13). Open since 2026-02-20.
- **Roster customization workflow**: Still undocumented. Open since 2026-02-20.
- **integration-with-moollm.md**: Still hardcodes roster by name. Open since 2026-02-20.
- **Spec calibration from test**: Resolution YAML schema, scenarios assumption minimum count, charter bridge key_assumption. Open.
- **`/probe` still untested**: Last untested skill.
- **`/review` on methodology-adoption deliberation**: Would test whether review skill handles scenario-aware resolution format. Not run.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Quickstart guide update** (low effort): Add reference to when-methodology-fails.md as recommended reading before first committee use. Committee explicitly recommended this; carried from fourth session.
2. **Monitoring infrastructure** (if mg wants it): Fourth robust action — monthly GitHub analytics, quarterly uptake review, Google Scholar citation alerts. Editorial/operational.
3. **Commit**: New/modified files ready. mg commits himself.
4. **Remediation flow test** (carried): Run on is-author-crackpot.
5. **`/review` on methodology-adoption deliberation** (carried): Test review skill on scenario-aware resolution.
6. **`/probe` test** (carried): Last untested skill; expensive (N× full pipeline).

## Working with mg: Session-Specific Insights

- **Short, directive requests**: This session was "add 1 and 2 as TODOs, create a plan, do it" — no intermediate checkpoints. Same autonomy pattern as previous sessions.
- **Handoff at session end**: User invoked `/handoff` after work completed. Consistent with prior sessions.

## Open Questions and Decisions Needed

1. **Adoption strategy** (carried): Does mg want external adoption? If Scholarly Archive is desired, robust actions are overhead. Maya’s flag stands.
2. **Quickstart guide**: Committee recommended when-methodology-fails reference. Low effort; batch with other edits or do alone?
3. **Monitoring infrastructure**: Operational setup (GitHub, Scholar alerts, uptake-and-usage cadence). Who does it, when?
4. **Probe cost** (carried): `/probe` at N=3 expensive. Abbreviated runs acceptable?
5. **Roster customization workflow** (carried): Still undocumented.
6. **Composed `/decide` skill** (carried): Manual composition works. Time to compose?

## Technical Notes

- **No code execution**: All outputs were Markdown. No Python, no build steps.
- **Start Here path**: Uses relative links from `artifacts/` (e.g. `../essays/01-...`, `quick-start-guide.md`). Correct for repo root or artifacts/ as context.
- **Full-pipeline example**: Links to agent/scenarios and agent/deliberations use relative paths from `artifacts/examples/` (e.g. `../../agent/...`). Verify from repo root if link checkers are used.

## Watch-Outs for Successor

- **Adoption-strategy robust actions**: Three of four done. Only monitoring infrastructure left. gap_analysis TODO section now has Start Here and full-pipeline example as done (strikethrough + note).
- **full-pipeline-worked-example.md is the methodology-adoption-strategy run**: It doesn’t duplicate the deliberation; it points to the existing records and adds commentary. Don’t create a second "example" run — this document is the worked example.
- **Start Here vs essays/README**: Start Here is the short 15-min path (01, 02, 03 + try). essays/README has longer paths (Practitioner, Theorist, Skeptic, Formalist). Start Here links to essays/README under "What next?" for deeper theory.

## Theoretical/Conceptual Notes

- **Worked example as proof of concept**: The methodology-adoption-strategy committee recommended a full-pipeline worked example and noted that *that* deliberation could serve as it. The new doc makes that explicit and adds commentary on what the process surfaced (scenario-aware resolution format, key assumption surfaced, resilience strategy). The example is self-referential in a useful way.
- **Start Here as minimal accessibility**: Vic’s point (Accidental Standard catches us unprepared) is addressed by Start Here: one page, ~15 min, no simplification of theory — enough to prevent fumbling if traffic spikes.

## What Worked Well / What To Do Differently

- **Parallel reads**: Reading scenario + deliberation + resolution in parallel gave enough context to write the worked example without re-running anything.
- **Reusing resolution language**: Start Here and full-pipeline doc stayed close to the resolution’s wording ("15-minute onboarding," "honest commentary on what the process surfaced") so deliverables match committee intent.

## Context for Specific Files

| File | Note |
|------|------|
| `README.md` | Link fixes in Essays, Artifacts, References lists. "Getting started" leads with Start Here. |
| `artifacts/start-here.md` | New. 15-min path; links to 01, 02, 03, quick-start, adversarial-committees, deliberated-choice, full-pipeline example, when-methodology-fails. |
| `artifacts/examples/full-pipeline-worked-example.md` | New. Pipeline table → situation/scenarios/committee/resolution summaries → honest commentary. Points to agent/scenarios/methodology-adoption-strategy/ and agent/deliberations/methodology-adoption-strategy/. |
| `agent/gap_analysis.md` | Start Here and Full-pipeline worked example: added as TODOs, then marked done with completion notes. |
| `agent/archive/handoff-2026-02-21-e.md` | Archived fourth session (when-methodology-fails + committee evaluation). |
