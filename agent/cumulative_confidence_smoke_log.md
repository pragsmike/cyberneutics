# Cumulative confidence smoke test — run log

Append one row after each full smoke test (baseline + with-register + review both + compare). Use this to see aggregate evidence across topics.

| Date       | Topic slug        | Baseline sum | With-register sum | Calibration mentioned |
|------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|------------------------|
| 2026-02-24 | readme-glossary   | 12           | 13               | Y                      |
| 2026-02-24 | readme-limitations| 11           | 13               | Y                      |

*Next run: add a row with date, topic slug, the two sums from the comparison report, and Y/N for calibration language in the with-register run.*
