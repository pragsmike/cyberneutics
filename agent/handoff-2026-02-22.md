# Session Handoff: 2026-02-22

## Session Summary

**Duration:** Single session. User asked to step back from the metacognition work, avoid overengineering, then ran a committee on whether the metacog process is useful, completed the review/remediation loop, and prepared for maintainer handoff.

**Main Accomplishments:**

- **Metacog simplification.** Removed or demoted from the main path: three-topic metacog smoke test (now optional); HMeta-d / nR_S1–nR_S2 / build_metacog_counts (moved to "Going further" in the metacognition artifact). Run guide and cumulative-confidence-smoke-test artifact were slimmed. The metacognition artifact now leads with a "What the user gets and when" table; the single canonical test is the cumulative-confidence test (same topic baseline vs with-register, review both, compare).
- **Committee: Is the metacog process useful?** (`agent/deliberations/metacog-process-useful/`). Topic: keep and recommend the metacog process (confidence, register, with-register, comparison test)? Consider user benefit, overhead, optional vs default, and conditions for removal. **Outcome:** PASSED (unanimous). **Decision:** Keep with a **tiered recommendation** and **sunset clause**. Recommend confidence at resolution; recommend register when running many committees; support with-register and the comparison test but do not recommend with-register as default until we have ≥3 comparison runs showing benefit. Add sunset: deprecate with-register if fewer than 3 of the first 5 comparison runs show benefit; revisit at 12 months or 5 runs.
- **Review and remediation.** First review: 11/15 (Medium); three gaps (proxy assumption unstated, register-usage question unanswered, sunset clause not one sentence). Committee responded in **Round 3** (05-remediation-1.md): Vic stated proxy assumption; Frankie answered register usage (primary consumers = with-register run + maintainers); Tammy proposed one-sentence sunset trigger. Resolution updated. Second review: **15/15 (High)**. No further gaps.
- **Artifacts updated per resolution.** `artifacts/metacognition-and-committee-veracity.md` and `artifacts/cumulative-confidence-smoke-test.md` now state: tiered recommendation, explicit assumptions (review sum and calibration-mentioned are unvalidated proxies; register usage unknown, primary consumers with-register run and maintainers), and the one-sentence sunset trigger: "Deprecate with-register if fewer than 3 of the first 5 comparison runs show with-register ≥ baseline AND calibration mentioned in the resolution or transcript. Revisit at 12 months or 5 comparison runs, whichever comes first."

**Original intent:** Simplify metacog, then committee to decide if it's useful; prepare for maintainer handoff.

**Actual outcome:** Simplification done; committee ran and passed; review → remediation → 15/15; artifacts aligned with resolution; handoff created. Ready for maintainer.

## Mistakes and Lessons

- **None material.** The register update script (`python scripts/update_metacog_register.py`) was not run in this environment (sandbox/exit issue); maintainer can run it locally so `metacog-process-useful` is included in the register.

## Dead Ends Explored

None.

## Current State

### Completed This Session

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| `artifacts/metacognition-and-committee-veracity.md` | Slimmed: "What the user gets and when" table; HMeta-d / three-topic test moved to "Going further (optional)"; added tiered recommendation, proxy/register assumptions, one-sentence sunset. |
| `artifacts/cumulative-confidence-smoke-test.md` | Slimmed §8–9 to short "Optional extensions"; added tiered recommendation, assumptions, sunset trigger in intro. |
| `meta/repository-review-and-run-guide.md` | §2.3 one subsection for metacog (confidence → register → test); three-topic test optional one-liner; §3.2 E metacog test optional. |
| `agent/deliberations/README.md` | Shortened metacog paragraph; pointer to artifact. |
| `agent/deliberations/metacog-process-useful/` | **New.** 00-charter through 06-evaluation-2. Committee + review (11/15) + remediation (05, Round 3) + second review (15/15). Resolution: keep, tiered recommendation, sunset. |
| `agent/archive/handoff-2026-02-22-pre-metacog-session.md` | Previous 2026-02-22 handoff archived (repository review, CI, Condorcet, comparisons). Full content in git history. |

### In Progress

- **Nothing.** All planned work this session is complete.

### Carried Forward (from prior handoffs, still relevant)

- Run `python scripts/update_metacog_register.py` locally so the register includes `metacog-process-useful` (optional but recommended).
- Comparative evaluation (one decision, three methods, same rubric); `/probe` untested; quickstart/when-methodology-fails reference.
- From archived 2026-02-22 handoff: CI workflow for string-diagram smoke test; comparison runs under `agent/comparisons/`.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Maintainer review:** Read this handoff; skim `agent/deliberations/metacog-process-useful/03-resolution.md` and `06-evaluation-2.md`; confirm artifact wording in `artifacts/metacognition-and-committee-veracity.md` and `artifacts/cumulative-confidence-smoke-test.md`.
2. **Optional — update register:** Run `python scripts/update_metacog_register.py` from repo root so `agent/metacog_register.md` includes the metacog-process-useful deliberation.
3. **Commit:** Suggested scope — artifacts (metacognition, cumulative-confidence-smoke-test), meta/repository-review-and-run-guide.md, agent/deliberations/README.md, agent/deliberations/metacog-process-useful/, agent/archive/handoff-2026-02-22-pre-metacog-session.md, agent/handoff-2026-02-22.md.

## Ready for Maintainer Review

### What changed this session (metacog)

- **Docs:** Metacognition and cumulative-confidence-smoke-test artifacts now state tiered recommendation, proxy/register assumptions, and one-sentence sunset. Run guide metacog section is one subsection + optional three-topic line.
- **Deliberation:** `agent/deliberations/metacog-process-useful/` — committee on "keep and recommend metacog process?" Resolution: yes, tiered + sunset. Review 11 → remediation (Round 3) → review 15/15.
- **Handoff:** This file replaces the earlier 2026-02-22 handoff (archived as `agent/archive/handoff-2026-02-22-pre-metacog-session.md`).

### Suggested maintainer actions

1. Read this handoff and, if desired, the resolution and second evaluation in `agent/deliberations/metacog-process-useful/`.
2. Optionally run `python scripts/update_metacog_register.py` so the register reflects the new deliberation.
3. Commit when satisfied (see Immediate Next Steps).

## Working with mg: Session-Specific Insights

- User asked to "step back" and avoid overengineering before locking in the metacog design; simplification (main path vs optional) and then committee on usefulness matched that.
- User was comfortable running the full loop: committee → review → remediation → second review. Handoff is explicitly "ready for maintainer" with a short checklist.

---

## Open Questions and Decisions Needed

- None blocking. Optional: run more cumulative-confidence comparison tests on new topics and log in `agent/cumulative_confidence_smoke_log.md`; at 12 months or 5 runs, evaluate against the sunset trigger.

---

## Technical Notes

- **Metacog process:** Confidence at resolution (default in skill); register via `update_metacog_register.py`; with-register mode = slug `<topic-slug>-with-register`; comparison = baseline vs with-register, review both, `compare_cumulative_confidence_runs.py`. Sunset trigger is in both metacognition and cumulative-confidence-smoke-test artifacts.
- **Deliberation record:** metacog-process-useful has 00–06 (charter, roster, convening, deliberation with Round 3, resolution, 04-evaluation-1, 05-remediation-1, 06-evaluation-2). Votes and confidence (1–4) in 03-resolution.md.
