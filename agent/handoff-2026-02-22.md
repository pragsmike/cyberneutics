# Session Handoff: 2026-02-22 (PR Review and Documentation Update)

**Note:** Two earlier sessions from 2026-02-22 have been archived:
- `agent/archive/handoff-2026-02-22-condorcet.md` — the condorcet contributor session (review/run guide, smoke test, deliberations, comparison protocol, comparison runs)
- `agent/archive/handoff-2026-02-22-wild-verification.md` — wild-material-incorporation verification and Pask quote session

## Session Summary

**Duration**: Single session. mg merged the Condorcet experiment PR and asked for thorough review, documentation updates, and housekeeping.

**Main Accomplishments**:
- **Exhaustive PR review**: Reviewed all 45 files changed in the merged Condorcet PR against the project's documented assumptions. Determined which committee phase it affects (none — it adds a parallel pipeline and documentation, not modifying existing phases), how it fits with assumptions (strong alignment), and how it validates the Roberts Rules forcing function practice (the code-of-conduct comparison is the best empirical evidence yet for Statistical Shortcut #1: Premature Consensus).
- **Handoff split**: Separated the merged `handoff-2026-02-22.md` into two clean standalone files — condorcet session archived to `agent/archive/handoff-2026-02-22-condorcet.md`, wild-verification content retained in `agent/handoff-2026-02-22.md`.
- **Documentation updates propagating PR learnings**: Updated 7 files to reflect what the Condorcet experiment validated:
  - `meta/uptake-and-usage.md` — Feb 22 update under Adoption Event #1 with completed investigation, comparison evidence, validated claims, updated predicted signals table
  - `meta/methodology-evolution.md` — new development trajectory entry, updated equilibrium and adoption sections
  - `README.md` — evidence base paragraph now references comparison evidence and CJT doc
  - `artifacts/roberts-rules-forcing-function.md` — empirical evidence note under Statistical Shortcut #1
  - `artifacts/adversarial-committees.md` — new "Evidence: deliberation vs. independent aggregation" subsection under "What Success Looks Like"
  - `CLAUDE.md` — repository map now includes `agent/comparisons/`
- **PR review archived**: Comprehensive review written to `agent/archive/condorcet-pr-review.md`
- **Maintainer review checklist verified and archived**: All items in `agent/ready-for-maintainer-review.md` confirmed addressed; archived to `agent/archive/ready-for-maintainer-review-2026-02-22.md`
- **Quick-start guide updated**: Added `when-methodology-fails.md` to recommended reading in `artifacts/quick-start-guide.md` (carried forward item, now complete)

**Original intent**: mg asked for PR review → documentation updates → housekeeping → quick-start fix → handoff.

**Actual outcome**: All completed as requested. Three outstanding optional items remain (see below).

## Mistakes and Lessons

- **Tool sequencing**: The `Edit` and `Write` tools require a fresh `Read` of the target file in the same session before they'll work, even if the file was read in a previous conversation turn that got compacted. Multiple edits failed with "File has not been read yet" errors. **Lesson for successor**: always read a file immediately before editing it if there's any chance the prior read was in a compacted context window.
- **`gh` CLI not available**: Tried `gh pr view 3` to inspect the PR — `gh` is not on PATH in this environment. Used `git diff` on specific commits instead. **Lesson**: use git directly for diff inspection; don't assume GitHub CLI is available.
- **Python not on PATH**: Could not run `python scripts/test_string_diagram.py` to verify the smoke test. Verified correctness by file inspection instead. **Lesson**: this environment may not have Python readily available in the bash shell.

## Current State

### Completed This Session

| Item | Location / note |
|------|------------------|
| PR review | `agent/archive/condorcet-pr-review.md` |
| Handoff split | `agent/archive/handoff-2026-02-22-condorcet.md` (condorcet session); `agent/archive/handoff-2026-02-22-wild-verification.md` (wild-verification session) |
| meta/uptake-and-usage.md update | Feb 22 update under Adoption Event #1; updated predicted signals table; new "deliberation vs. aggregation" row |
| meta/methodology-evolution.md update | Feb 22 development trajectory entry; updated equilibrium and adoption sections |
| README.md evidence base | Now references comparison evidence and links to CJT doc and comparison protocol |
| artifacts/roberts-rules-forcing-function.md | Empirical evidence paragraph under Statistical Shortcut #1 |
| artifacts/adversarial-committees.md | "Evidence: deliberation vs. independent aggregation" subsection |
| CLAUDE.md repository map | Added `comparisons/<topic-slug>/` to `agent/` table |
| ready-for-maintainer-review.md | Verified and archived to `agent/archive/ready-for-maintainer-review-2026-02-22.md` |
| Quick-start guide | Added `when-methodology-fails.md` to recommended reading list |

### Outstanding Optional Items

1. **CI workflow**: The CI deliberation recommended adding a GitHub Actions workflow that runs `scripts/test_string_diagram.py`. Not implemented. mg has not decided whether to add it.
2. **Full comparative evaluation**: One decision, three methods (committee, simple pros/cons, individual LLM call), same rubric — the committee's #1 evidence gap. The two deliberative-vs-CJT comparisons are partial evidence but don't cover the full three-method protocol. Requires mg's go-ahead and a chosen decision.
3. **gap_analysis.md closure**: Update per wild-material-incorporation plan Part 5 (completed Essay 11, residuality absorption, three strikethrough TODOs). Low priority paperwork.

### Plans Awaiting mg's Go-Ahead

- **`meta/research-plans/evaluation-schemes.md`**: Experimental designs for testing whether committees beat simpler methods. Plan only; not executed.
- **`meta/research-plans/multi-model-committee.md`**: Investigation of using different LLMs for different characters. Plan only; not executed.

### Carried Forward (still relevant)

- `/probe` still untested; `/review` on methodology-adoption (scenario-aware) not run.
- Roster customization workflow undocumented; `integration-with-moollm.md` hardcodes roster.

---

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Comparative evaluation** (highest value): Run one decision through three methods (committee, simple pros/cons, individual LLM call) with same rubric. Requires mg to choose a decision. This is the #1 evidence gap.
2. **If mg wants to pursue plans**: Evaluation-schemes analysis and/or multi-model-committee analysis — both exist as written plans in `agent/`.
3. **If closing paperwork**: Update `agent/gap_analysis.md` per wild-material-incorporation plan Part 5.
4. **If testing infrastructure**: Run `/probe` on a topic to validate the probe skill; run `/review` on methodology-adoption with scenario context.

## Working with mg: Session-Specific Insights

- **Structured delegation**: mg gives clear, sequenced instructions ("Do 2. Then handoff.") and expects autonomous execution without confirmation prompts. Follow the sequence literally.
- **Documentation propagation**: When a PR validates claims, mg expects those claims to be updated across all documents that make them — not just the primary artifact. Think about which essays, artifacts, READMEs, and meta/ files contain claims that are now stronger, and update them proactively.
- **Housekeeping valued**: mg explicitly asked to verify the ready-for-maintainer-review checklist, archive it when done, and write the PR review into archive/. Clean closure of administrative artifacts matters.
- **"Carried forward" items**: mg tracks these across handoffs and will explicitly ask to resolve them (as with the quick-start guide item this session). Keep the carried-forward list honest and short.

---

## Open Questions and Decisions Needed

- **CI workflow**: Add the GitHub Actions job for `scripts/test_string_diagram.py`, or defer? Committee recommended it; implementation is straightforward.
- **Comparative evaluation**: What decision should be used for the three-method comparison? mg needs to choose a real or realistic decision to run through all three pipelines.
- **Evaluation-schemes / multi-model-committee**: Pursue one or both? Plans exist in `agent/`; execution depends on mg.

---

## Technical Notes

- **Environment constraints**: This Windows environment does not have `gh` CLI or `python` readily available on PATH in the bash shell. Use `git` directly for repository inspection. File verification by inspection rather than execution.
- **Tool sequencing requirement**: Always `Read` a file immediately before `Edit` or `Write` if the previous read might have been compacted. The tools enforce a "read before edit" contract per session context.
- **Three handoffs for one date**: 2026-02-22 now has three handoff documents because three separate agent sessions worked on this date. The two earlier ones are archived with suffixes (`-condorcet`, `-wild-verification`). This one is the current active handoff.

---

## Watch-Outs for Successor

- **Don't re-review the Condorcet PR**: Review is complete and archived at `agent/archive/condorcet-pr-review.md`. All documentation updates have been propagated.
- **Don't re-verify wild-material-incorporation**: Verified in an earlier session; report at `agent/wild-material-incorporation-verification.md`.
- **Essay 06 Pask passage**: mg has edited the opening of "The Category Theory Connection" section. Respect mg's wording; do not revert.
- **Quick-start guide `when-methodology-fails.md` reference**: Just added this session. It's in the "Read the detailed techniques" list under "What to Do Next". Don't add it again.
- **The code-of-conduct comparison is the crown jewel**: When discussing evidence for the methodology, the code-of-conduct comparison (CJT Aye 3-2, Deliberative Nay 5-0 — opposite verdicts from same roster) is the strongest empirical evidence. It's now documented in `meta/uptake-and-usage.md`, `artifacts/adversarial-committees.md`, `artifacts/roberts-rules-forcing-function.md`, and `README.md`.
