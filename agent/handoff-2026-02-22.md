# Session Handoff: 2026-02-22

## Session Summary

**Duration:** Single session. User asked for an in-depth repository review and run/test guidance, then ran committee and comparison work (CI, Condorcet, deliberative vs. CJT-style).

**Main Accomplishments:**

- **Repository review and run/test guide** (`meta/repository-review-and-run-guide.md`). What the repo is (docs + one script, skills in AI session), how to run (skills in chat, Python script), how to test (smoke test, structural checks, manual methodology validation). `meta/README.md` updated.
- **Smoke test for string-diagram script** (`scripts/test_string_diagram.py`). Runs the equation→Mermaid converter on the three equation files; exit 0 and "flowchart" check. No deps. Run from repo root: `python scripts/test_string_diagram.py`.
- **CI job deliberation** (`agent/deliberations/ci-string-diagram-test/`). Committee: add CI that runs the smoke test, with documented scope. Review scored 9/15; remediation added Round 2 (Vic→Joe, Frankie→Maya, Joe clarified environment claim). Resolution: add CI; not yet implemented (maintainer to add workflow if desired).
- **Condorcet jury theorem** — Committee deliberation (`agent/deliberations/condorcet-jury-theorem-process/`): recommend document, don't change process. Review 13/15 (High). **Artifact created:** `artifacts/condorcet-jury-theorem-and-committee.md` (design goals first, CJT as analogy, deviations, CJT-compliant = different pipeline). Link added in `artifacts/adversarial-committees.md`.
- **Comparison protocol** (`artifacts/comparison-protocol-deliberative-vs-cjt.md`). How to run deliberative vs. CJT-style (independent vote then aggregate) on the same question and compare.
- **Two comparison runs:**  
  - **second-ci-job:** CJT Nay 4–1, Deliberative Nay 5–0 (same verdict; Frankie moved Aye→Nay, revisit condition added).  
  - **code-of-conduct:** **CJT Aye 3–2, Deliberative Nay 5–0 (opposite verdicts).** Three votes flipped after debate on enforcement/weaponization.
- **Comparison records:** `agent/comparisons/` with README; `agent/comparisons/second-ci-job/`, `agent/comparisons/code-of-conduct/` (00-charter, CJT-style votes, deliberative summary, comparison summary each).

**Original intent:** In-depth review, run/test guidance, then hand back to maintainer for review.

**Actual outcome:** Review + runbook, smoke test, two committee runs (CI, Condorcet), Condorcet artifact, comparison protocol, two comparison runs showing same vs. different outcomes. Ready for maintainer review.

## Mistakes and Lessons

- **None material.** Slash commands were clarified (chat vs. terminal) when user tried `/committee` in PowerShell.
- **Lesson:** Comparison runs need a value-laden or enforcement-sensitive question to get divergent results; second-ci-job agreed, code-of-conduct disagreed.
**Duration**: Single session. This agent did not execute the wild-material-incorporation plan; another agent did. This session: (1) verified the plan against the codebase, (2) added the Pask defensible-metaphors quote to Essay 06 (category theory section), (3) received mg's note that mg edited that passage, and (4) created this handoff using the other agent's completion summary.

**Main Accomplishments**:
- **Verification of wild-material-incorporation**: Checked `agent/archive/wild-material-incorporation-plan.md` against essays, artifacts, and palgebra. Confirmed: no `wild/` refs in main-line content, no neo-cybernetics in main parts, Pask/von Foerster/O'Reilly material present as specified. Verification report written to `agent/wild-material-incorporation-verification.md`.
- **Pask quote in Essay 06**: Inserted Pask's "cybernetics is the science or the art of manipulating defensible metaphors…" (from *The Cybernetics of Human Learning and Performance*, 1966) and "The same is true of category theory" at the start of "The Category Theory Connection" in `essays/06-deleuze-difference-repetition.md`. **mg has since edited this passage** — successor should treat the current text in that section as mg's preferred wording.
- **Handoff dossier**: This document, consolidating the other agent's summary and current state for the next session.

**Original intent**: mg asked to verify that the wild-material-incorporation plan had been carried out in full; then to add the Pask/category-theory text; then to create a handoff given the other agent's summary.

**Actual outcome**: Verification completed (two minor gaps noted in verification doc: Essay 02 defensible-metaphors was missing — content was placed in Essay 06 instead; gap_analysis.md Part 5 update not done). Pask quote added; mg edited it. Handoff created.

## Wild-Material Incorporation: Other Agent's Summary (Executed and Verified)

- **Phase 1 — Essay augmentations**: Pask, von Foerster, and O'Reilly material woven into Essays 01, 03, 04, 05, 06, 08, and 10. Direct citations only; no wild/ refs, no neo-cybernetics.
- **Phase 2 — New documents**: Essay 11 (Conversation Theory) establishes Pask as fourth pillar; Teachback Protocol artifact in `artifacts/teachback-protocol.md`.
- **Phase 3 — Final augmentations**: Essays 07 (BCL precedent) and 09 (teachback-as-immune).
- **Infrastructure**: Both READMEs updated; `palgebra/duality-and-composition.md` cleaned of wild/ refs.
- **Verification**: Zero wild/ in essays, artifacts, palgebra; zero neo-cybernetics in main-line content.

**Verification report**: `agent/wild-material-incorporation-verification.md`. It notes (1) Essay 02 never received the planned "defensible metaphors" footnote — the idea was placed in Essay 06 instead; (2) `agent/gap_analysis.md` was not updated per plan Part 5 (completed Essay 11 / residuality absorption and the three wild-incorporation TODOs). Updating gap_analysis per Part 5 is optional closure.

---

## Mistakes and Lessons

- **None material.** Verification was systematic; insertion point for Pask quote was the natural place (Essay 06, category theory section). mg's edit to the passage is normal editorial control.

## Dead Ends Explored

None.

### In Progress

- **Nothing.** All planned work this session is complete.

### Carried Forward (from previous handoffs, still relevant)

- Quickstart guide: add when-methodology-fails.md reference (low effort).
- Comparative evaluation (one decision, three methods, same rubric) — committee's #1 evidence gap; we did two deliberative-vs-CJT comparisons instead.
- `/probe` still untested; `/review` on methodology-adoption (scenario-aware) not run.
- Roster customization workflow undocumented; integration-with-moollm.md hardcodes roster.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Maintainer review:** Read this handoff and `agent/ready-for-maintainer-review.md` (if present); skim new artifacts and comparison summaries; run `python scripts/test_string_diagram.py` locally if desired.
2. **Commit:** New and modified files are ready (see "Ready for maintainer review" below). Suggested scope: meta/, scripts/, artifacts/, agent/deliberations/, agent/comparisons/.
3. **Optional — add CI:** Committee recommended adding a CI job that runs `scripts/test_string_diagram.py` with documented scope. Implement only if maintainer agrees.
4. **Optional — quickstart:** Add when-methodology-fails.md to quick-start recommended reading (carried from prior handoff).

## Ready for Maintainer Review

**Purpose:** Hand-back to maintainer (mg) for review. Below is a minimal checklist so mg can quickly see what’s new and what to do.

### What was added (for review)

- **Docs:** `meta/repository-review-and-run-guide.md`, `artifacts/condorcet-jury-theorem-and-committee.md`, `artifacts/comparison-protocol-deliberative-vs-cjt.md`.
- **Test:** `scripts/test_string_diagram.py` (smoke test; run from repo root).
- **Deliberations:** `agent/deliberations/ci-string-diagram-test/` (with remediation), `agent/deliberations/condorcet-jury-theorem-process/`, `agent/deliberations/second-ci-job/`, `agent/deliberations/code-of-conduct/`.
- **Comparisons:** `agent/comparisons/` (README + second-ci-job + code-of-conduct). Code-of-conduct run shows **deliberative vs. CJT-style giving opposite verdicts** (Aye vs. Nay).

### Suggested maintainer actions

1. **Review** this handoff and, if helpful, `meta/repository-review-and-run-guide.md`.
2. **Run** `python scripts/test_string_diagram.py` locally (should see three OK lines).
3. **Skim** `artifacts/condorcet-jury-theorem-and-committee.md` and `agent/comparisons/code-of-conduct/04-comparison-summary.md` to see Condorcet doc and comparison result.
4. **Decide** whether to add the CI workflow (committee recommended it; implementation not done).
5. **Commit** when satisfied (all new/modified files under meta/, scripts/, artifacts/, agent/ as above).

### Open questions for maintainer

- Add the CI job now, or leave for later?
- Keep comparison runs under `agent/comparisons/` as-is, or move/rename?
- Anything to change in the Condorcet artifact or comparison protocol before treating as final?

## Working with mg: Session-Specific Insights

- User (or mg) requested clear hand-off for maintainer review; structured "ready for review" and file list support that.
- Comparison runs were user-driven (CI topic, then Condorcet, then "something that gives different results" → code-of-conduct). Maintainer may want to run more comparisons or treat these as sufficient for now.

## Open Questions and Decisions Needed

1. **CI workflow:** Implement the committee’s recommendation (add CI for `scripts/test_string_diagram.py`) or defer?
2. **Comparative evaluation** (from prior handoff): The full "one decision, three methods, same rubric" study is still the committee’s #1 evidence gap. This session did two deliberative-vs-CJT comparisons instead. Proceed with full comparative evaluation later?
3. **Comparison runs:** Keep under `agent/comparisons/` and reference from run guide or README?

## Technical Notes

- **Slash commands:** `/committee`, `/review`, etc. run in **Cursor chat**, not in the terminal. Terminal is for `python scripts/test_string_diagram.py` and similar.
- **Two deliberation dirs for same topic:** second-ci-job and code-of-conduct each have both `agent/deliberations/<slug>/` (deliberative) and `agent/comparisons/<slug>/` (charter + CJT-style + comparison summary). Deliberative is the full transcript; comparison dir points to it and holds CJT-style votes and 04-comparison-summary.

## Session Metadata

**Agent:** Session that produced review/run guide, smoke test, CI and Condorcet deliberations, Condorcet artifact, comparison protocol, and two comparison runs.  
**Date:** 2026-02-22  
**Goal:** In-depth review, run/test readiness, hand-back to maintainer.  
**Status:** Complete. Ready for maintainer review.  
**Continuation priority:** Maintainer review → commit → optional CI and quickstart update.
| Item | Location / note |
|------|------------------|
| Verification report | `agent/wild-material-incorporation-verification.md` |
| Pask + category theory passage | `essays/06-deleuze-difference-repetition.md` — "The Category Theory Connection" (mg edited) |
| Handoff | This file |

### Completed by Other Agent (No Further Action Required)

- Full execution of `agent/archive/wild-material-incorporation-plan.md`: essay augmentations, Essay 11, Teachback Protocol, READMEs, palgebra cleanup.

### Optional Follow-Up

- **gap_analysis.md**: Add "Essays (completed via wild material incorporation)" and the three completed TODOs from plan Part 5 if mg wants the plan fully closed in gap_analysis.

### Plans Awaiting mg's Go-Ahead

- **`agent/evaluation-schemes-analysis.md`**: Experimental designs for testing whether committees beat simpler methods. Plan only; not executed.
- **`agent/multi-model-committee-analysis.md`**: Investigation of using different LLMs for different characters. Plan only; not executed.

---

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Continue from previous handoff priorities** (see handoff-2026-02-21): Comparative evaluation (highest value), quickstart guide update, `/review` on methodology-adoption, `/probe` test, etc.
2. **If closing plan paperwork**: Update `agent/gap_analysis.md` per wild-material-incorporation plan Part 5 (completed Essay 11, residuality absorption, three strikethrough TODOs).
3. **If mg wants to pursue**: Evaluation-schemes analysis and/or multi-model-committee analysis — both are written plans in `agent/` awaiting approval.

---

## Working with mg: Session-Specific Insights

- **Multi-agent continuity**: mg treated "another agent carried out the plan, you verified" as normal. Handoff should make it clear what this agent did vs. what was already done, so the next agent doesn't re-verify or duplicate.
- **Editorial control**: mg explicitly noted editing the passage just added. Successor should not overwrite mg's edits when touching Essay 06.

---

## Open Questions and Decisions Needed

- **Comparative evaluation** (from 2026-02-21 handoff): Still the highest-value next step; requires mg's go-ahead and a chosen decision to run.
- **Evaluation-schemes / multi-model-committee**: Pursue one or both? Plans exist; execution depends on mg.

---

## Technical Notes

- **Plan location**: The full plan is archived at `agent/archive/wild-material-incorporation-plan.md`. The verification report is in `agent/` (not archived): `agent/wild-material-incorporation-verification.md`.
- **Essay 06**: The only file this agent modified. mg's edit applies to the opening of "The Category Theory Connection" section.

---

## Watch-Outs for Successor

- **Don't re-run wild incorporation**: The plan is executed and verified. Optional work is gap_analysis update and the two analysis docs if mg approves.
- **Essay 06 Pask passage**: Respect mg's edited version; do not "fix" it back to the original suggested text unless mg asks.
