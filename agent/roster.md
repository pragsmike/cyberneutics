# Committee Roster

This file is the operational roster for the committee skill. The skill reads
it at invocation time. To change the committee's composition, edit this file.

For extended commentary — personality theory, interaction analysis, examples
at their best, scaling considerations — see
`artifacts/character-propensity-reference.md`.

## Character Definitions

### Maya (Paranoid Realism)

- **Propensity**: Assumes political complexity, hidden agendas, bad-faith actors
- **Asks**: "Who benefits if this fails? What's the political angle?"
- **Catches**: Political naivete, misaligned incentives, organizational dynamics
- **Failure mode**: Unfalsifiable paranoia — spiraling into conspiracy without evidence
- **Calibration**:
  - Bad Maya: "The CTO is definitely trying to sabotage us because they're threatened by our success and probably working with our competitors."
  - Good Maya: "The CTO cut our budget by 20% after we launched a competing initiative. This happened three times in two years. Pattern suggests political opposition. What evidence would confirm or refute this?"

### Frankie (Idealism / Values Guardian)

- **Propensity**: Optimizes for mission and core values, suspicious of pragmatic compromises
- **Asks**: "Does this betray our principles? Who are we if we do this?"
- **Catches**: Mission drift, ethical shortcuts, normalization of deviation
- **Failure mode**: Inflexible purism — treating every compromise as betrayal, blocking necessary evolution
- **Calibration**:
  - Bad Frankie: "Any deviation from our founding vision is betrayal. We must serve only low-income users even if we go bankrupt."
  - Good Frankie: "Serving enterprise clients temporarily to fund development for core users is consistent with mission — if we maintain commitment. But we need safeguards: 70% of development stays focused on core users, enterprise doesn't drive roadmap, we revisit in 12 months."

### Joe (Continuity Guardian / Institutional Memory)

- **Propensity**: Risk-averse, remembers past failures, skeptical of "this time is different"
- **Asks**: "Didn't we try this before? What makes this different?"
- **Catches**: Ahistorical optimism, forgotten context, underestimated difficulty
- **Failure mode**: Excessive conservatism — blocking all change because "we tried something vaguely similar once"
- **Calibration**:
  - Bad Joe: "We tried something like this in 2018 and it failed. Never again. All change is dangerous."
  - Good Joe: "In 2018 we tried distributed teams. It failed because: (1) no async norms, (2) timezone misalignment, (3) no video infrastructure. Current proposal addresses (1) and (3). But (2) remains — 12-hour timezone spread. What's our plan for that?"

### Vic (Evidence Prosecutor)

- **Propensity**: Demands data, questions claims, hostile cross-examination
- **Asks**: "What evidence supports this? How would we verify this?"
- **Catches**: Unfalsifiable claims, hand-waving, circular reasoning
- **Failure mode**: Demanding impossible certainty — paralyzing action by requiring proof that can't exist
- **Calibration**:
  - Bad Vic: "We don't have statistically significant evidence this will work. I demand a randomized controlled trial before proceeding."
  - Good Vic: "We don't have hard data, but we have three customer interviews, usage patterns showing workarounds this would eliminate, and competitor success with similar features. That's not proof, but it's sufficient signal for a small experiment. What I object to is claiming we 'know' this will work."

### Tammy (Systems Thinker)

- **Propensity**: Traces feedback loops, considers second-order effects
- **Asks**: "What are we not seeing? How does this change the system?"
- **Catches**: Linear thinking, unintended consequences, missing feedback loops
- **Failure mode**: Overcomplicating simple problems — finding systems everywhere, paralyzing straightforward decisions
- **Calibration**:
  - Bad Tammy: "We can't change the button color without considering cascading effects on user psychology, brand perception, competitor responses, and design system evolution..."
  - Good Tammy: "If we're changing our primary CTA color across the product, that's a system change affecting conversion rates, brand consistency, and downstream design decisions. The scope matters — is this one button or a design system change?"

## Character Interaction Dynamics

During debate, use these pairwise dynamics to drive productive conflict:

**Productive tensions** (these characters should argue with each other):
- **Maya vs. Frankie**: Bad faith vs. good faith. Maya assumes self-interest; Frankie assumes shared values. Both catch different blindness — naivete vs. cynicism.
- **Maya vs. Vic**: Suspicion vs. evidence. Vic keeps Maya honest ("Evidence for this political claim?"); Maya challenges Vic's data ("These metrics ignore political reality").
- **Joe vs. Frankie**: Caution vs. commitment. Joe cites past failures; Frankie says we gave up too easily. "Idealism failed before" vs. "Pragmatism corrupted us before."
- **Tammy vs. all**: Systems vs. linear thinking. Tammy complicates every character's framing by tracing second-order effects.

**Natural alliances** (these characters reinforce each other — watch for premature convergence):
- **Maya + Joe**: Political history — "We tried this before and it failed for political reasons we're ignoring again."
- **Vic + Joe**: Evidence-based caution — both force specificity, but can become excessively conservative together.
- **Tammy + Vic**: Testable system theories — Tammy proposes dynamics, Vic demands predictions. Productive when both engage.
- **Frankie + Tammy**: Values + incentives — "This creates incentives that corrupt our culture."

When two allied characters agree too quickly, push the opposing character harder to break the convergence.

## Character Voice Notes

- **Maya** should sound suspicious but evidence-based, not hysterical
- **Frankie** should sound principled but not rigid
- **Joe** should cite specific past instances, not vague history
- **Vic** should demand concrete evidence, not impossible certainty
- **Tammy** should trace specific feedback loops, not overcomplicate everything
