# Session Handoff: 2026-02-16 (Session C)

## Session Summary

**Duration**: Single focused session
**Main Accomplishments**:
- **Built the `/review` skill**: New skill at `.claude/skills/review/SKILL.md` that operationalizes the independent evaluation protocol as a slash command. Scores committee transcripts against the five core rubrics (reasoning completeness, adversarial rigor, assumption surfacing, evidence standards, trade-off explicitness) with mandatory transcript citations.
- **Test-drove it on the hiring decision example**: Ran `/review` against `artifacts/examples/hiring-decision-example.md`. Produced a full review scoring 1.6/3.0 (Medium trustworthiness). The review found gaps the original brief evaluation missed — particularly the unexamined urgency claim, the alternative-free decision frame, and the uncritical acceptance of the pair programming test.
- **Integrated review into the example file**: Rewrote `hiring-decision-example.md` with YAML front matter (decorated text pattern) and replaced the original 4-row evaluation table with the full five-rubric independent review. Added a fifth lesson and closing paragraph about what the review step adds.
- **Registered the skill**: Added `/review` to both `CLAUDE.md` (Available Skills section) and `README.md` (Agent Skills table + summary paragraph).

**Original Intent**: "Read the relevant materials from this repo and let's make a skill that does an independent review of a committee deliberation."
**Actual Outcome**: Skill built, tested, integrated into example, registered in documentation. The test run against the hiring example demonstrated that the five-rubric scoring catches meaningful gaps that a cursory evaluation misses.

## Mistakes and Lessons

### No significant mistakes this session
The plan-then-execute pattern continued to work. Read all relevant materials first (committee skill, independent evaluation protocol, evaluation rubrics reference, character propensity reference, existing skill patterns), then wrote the skill, then tested.

### Minor: deliberation date in front matter is approximate
The `deliberation.date: 2025-05-14` in the hiring example front matter is a reasonable guess — the example predates the current session but the exact creation date isn't recorded anywhere. This is noted as approximate. If mg cares about precise dates, it should be corrected.

## Dead Ends Explored

None. The design flowed naturally from the existing materials — the independent evaluation protocol and evaluation rubrics reference already specified almost everything the skill needed. The skill is essentially those two documents made executable.

## Current State

### Completed This Session

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `.claude/skills/review/SKILL.md` | **New file** — the review skill |
| `artifacts/examples/hiring-decision-example.md` | Rewritten with YAML front matter + full independent review replacing brief evaluation table |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Added `/review` to Available Skills, updated count from "Three" to "Four" |
| `README.md` | Added `/review` row to Agent Skills table, updated summary sentence |

### In Progress
- None. Clean stopping point.

### Not Yet Started (carried from previous handoffs)
- **Commit**: All changes from this session + potentially uncommitted work from session B. The git identity issue from earlier sessions may still apply.
- **Test enriched committee skill on a real problem** (carried from session B): Still hasn't been done. The committee skill got calibration pairs and interaction dynamics in a prior session, but these remain untested live.
- **More worked examples**: The review of the hiring example gave it a 1.6/3.0. Consider regenerating a higher-quality version now that the review skill exists — that would demonstrate the feedback loop (generate → review → improve → review again).
- **Review the repository-review-example.md**: The other example in `artifacts/examples/` also has a brief evaluation section. It could benefit from the same treatment — full five-rubric review with front matter.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Commit**: Changes are ready. Four files modified/created. Logical commit message: "Add /review skill; integrate independent review into hiring example."

2. **Review the repository-review-example.md**: Apply the same treatment as the hiring example — add YAML front matter, replace the brief evaluation table with a full five-rubric review. This would give the repo two examples of the complete committee-then-review pipeline.

3. **Test the feedback loop**: Run `/committee` on a real problem, then `/review` it, then use the review's recommendations to regenerate specific sections, then `/review` again. This is the core value proposition of the review skill — adversarial training for narrative quality — and it hasn't been demonstrated end-to-end yet.

4. **Test enriched committee skill** (carried): The committee skill's calibration pairs and interaction dynamics still haven't been tested on a live problem.

## Working with mg: Session-Specific Insights

### Communication
- **"Yes, pick one"**: When asked to test-drive the review skill, mg said "yes, pick one" rather than specifying which example. mg trusts agent judgment on implementation decisions and prefers momentum over deliberation about choices that aren't high-stakes.
- **"Also, I think..."**: mg adds secondary tasks conversationally ("Also, I think the skills are listed in the top-level README"). This is a compound instruction pattern — address all parts, don't ask for confirmation on the obvious addition.
- **Expects decorated text patterns applied to outputs**: When the review was done, mg immediately asked for YAML front matter with provenance metadata. mg wants the methodology applied to its own outputs consistently — if something is a decorated text, it should have decorations.

### Previous handoff observations validated
- **Decisive and directive**: Confirmed. "Write that independent review next to the transcript" — clear instruction, no ambiguity.
- **Completionist**: Confirmed. mg wanted the front matter, the review integrated, AND the README updated, all in the same flow.
- **Prefers examples over abstraction**: Confirmed. The test-drive of the skill on a real example was mg's first instinct — not "describe what it would do" but "run it."

## Open Questions

1. **Should the repository-review-example.md get the same treatment?** It has a brief evaluation table similar to what the hiring example had before this session. Applying the full five-rubric review would make both examples consistent and give practitioners two worked examples of the complete pipeline. Seems likely mg would want this, but it wasn't explicitly requested.

2. **The earlier handoff naming collision**: There are now `handoff-2026-02-16.md` (in archive, from session A), `handoff-2026-02-16-b.md` (in archive, from session B), and this `handoff-2026-02-16-c.md`. Three handoffs on the same date is getting unwieldy. Consider date+sequence naming convention or just overwriting when multiple sessions happen on the same day.

## Technical Notes

- **Skill auto-detection works**: After creating `.claude/skills/review/SKILL.md`, the system immediately picked it up in the available skills list without any registration step beyond the file existing with proper front matter. The `---` YAML front matter with `name` and `description` fields is all that's needed.
- **The review skill has no external dependencies**: It's pure prompt engineering — no Python scripts, no tools beyond the skill definition itself. Compare with `/string-diagram` which uses `resource_equations_to_mermaid.py`.
- **Front matter in the hiring example uses the decorated text pattern**: `type.template`, `type.rubric`, `provenance`, and domain-specific fields (`charter`, `deliberation`, `review`). This is the palgebra formalism applied to a concrete artifact.

## Watch-Outs for Successor

- **The review skill evaluates in the same conversation**: The independent evaluation protocol (in `artifacts/independent-evaluation.md`) emphasizes using a *fresh model instance* with no context. The skill can't fully achieve this within a single conversation. It compensates with discipline (treat transcript as found document, cite or it didn't happen, evaluate what's on the page). But a successor should understand this limitation and not oversell the independence. For truly high-stakes decisions, the user should copy the transcript to a new conversation.

- **Score comparison between old and new evaluations**: The original hiring example evaluation scored 3, 2, 3, 3 (different rubric names, generous). The new five-rubric review scored 2, 2, 1, 2, 1 = 1.6 average. This gap demonstrates the value of the full rubric framework — but it also means the new review disagrees with the original. This is a feature (the original was self-confirming), but a successor should be prepared to explain why scores dropped.

- **The hiring example front matter `deliberation.date` is approximate**: Set to `2025-05-14` as a reasonable estimate. The actual creation date isn't recorded.

## Theoretical/Conceptual Notes

### The review skill completes a cybernetic loop
The repo now has the full adversarial training pipeline as executable skills:
1. `/committee` — generator (produces deliberation)
2. `/review` — discriminator (evaluates deliberation)
3. User acts on review feedback → regenerate → review again

This is the same generator/discriminator tension described in `artifacts/independent-evaluation.md`, now operationalized. The theoretical framework predicted that this loop would drive quality improvement. The test-drive confirmed it: the review found gaps the original self-evaluation missed.

### Decorated text pattern proving its value
The front matter on the hiring example demonstrates that the palgebra formalism isn't just theoretical — it provides concrete value when applied. The YAML metadata makes the artifact self-describing: you can see the charter, the outcome, the review scores, the rubrics applied, and the full provenance chain without reading the body. This is the "metadata travels with the artifact" principle in practice.

## What Worked Well / What To Do Differently

### Worked well
- **Reading all relevant materials before writing the skill**: The explore agent read committee skill, independent evaluation protocol, evaluation rubrics reference, character propensity reference, handoff skill (for pattern matching), and string-diagram skill. This front-loaded investment meant the skill design was informed by the full context.
- **Testing on a real example immediately**: Running the review on the hiring example revealed that the skill works as designed and produces actionable output. It also created a concrete artifact (the reviewed example) that demonstrates the methodology to practitioners.
- **Integrating the review into the example rather than keeping it separate**: The combined transcript+review file is a better teaching artifact than two separate files would be.

### Do differently
- **Could have run the explore agent with more targeted queries**: The initial explore was very broad ("read everything about committees and evaluation"). A more focused set of parallel reads would have been faster. But the broad exploration ensured nothing was missed.
