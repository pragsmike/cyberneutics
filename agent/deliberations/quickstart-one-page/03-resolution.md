resolution:
  date: "2026-02-22"
  topic: "Should we add a one-page Quickstart that gets someone to their first committee run in under 10 minutes, even if it skips some nuance?"
  outcome: PASSED
  decision: "Aye, conditional. Produce a funnel-style one-page Quickstart (explicit 'what you're missing,' links to depth), run one naive-user test, then decide whether to publish or revise. Do not promise 'under 10 minutes' until the draft proves it."
  summary: |
    The committee voted 4 Aye, 1 Nay. Frankie and Tammy supported a Quickstart as a funnel to lower barrier; Maya and Vic moved to conditional Aye with safeguards (upfront caveats, draft → test → then publish). Joe remained Nay, citing precedent that quickstarts overpromise. Resolution: commit to producing the draft with funnel design, one naive-user test, then revisit publish/revise.
  implementation_plan:
    - action: "Draft one-page Quickstart with 'what you're missing' above the fold and links to essays/artifacts."
    - action: "Run one naive-user test; record time and confusion points."
    - action: "Revisit publish/revise decision after test."

    Maya: "Aye (conditional: upfront caveats, track shallow-use risk)"
    Frankie: "Aye"
    Joe: "Nay"
    Vic: "Aye (conditional: draft → test → then publish)"
    Tammy: "Aye"
