charter:
  goal: "Decide whether to add a one-page Quickstart that gets someone to their first committee run in under 10 minutes, even if it skips some nuance."
  context: |
    The methodology has multiple entry points (essays, artifacts, skills). New users may not know where to start. A very short Quickstart could lower the barrier but risks oversimplifying or creating overconfidence. This run feeds the metacognition smoke test; resolution must include vote and confidence (1-4) per member.
  success_criteria:
    - "Clear recommendation: Aye or Nay with rationale"
    - "Trade-off between accessibility and rigor named"
  exit_conditions:
    - "Committee delivers resolution with votes and confidence"
  deliverable_format: "Resolution Artifact + Decision Space Map"
