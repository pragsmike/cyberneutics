# Phase 2: Deliberation

**Topic:** Should we add a one-page Quickstart that gets someone to their first committee run in under 10 minutes, even if it skips some nuance?  
**Protocol:** Robert's Rules; adversarial engagement.

---

## Opening Statements

### Maya

A one-page Quickstart is a political liability. If we promise "first committee run in under 10 minutes," we're setting an expectation we can't control. The moment someone hits a nuance we skipped — and they will — they'll either blame the methodology ("this was oversold") or assume they're doing it wrong. Both outcomes damage credibility. I've seen projects collapse trust by overpromising on "quick start." The people who need this most are the ones who will skip the essays and go straight to the Quickstart; if the Quickstart is thin, they'll run a committee that looks like the methodology but isn't, and then cite us when it goes badly. I'm not against lowering the barrier. I'm against packaging complexity as simplicity without a clear "and here's what you're missing" signpost.

### Frankie

The barrier to first use is too high. If someone has to read three essays and two artifacts before they can run a committee, we're optimizing for the wrong thing. The methodology's value is in the *experience* of adversarial deliberation — you have to feel it. A one-page Quickstart that gets someone to "/committee Should we do X?" in under 10 minutes serves the mission: more people actually *using* the thing. Yes, nuance gets skipped. So we say so. "This is the minimal path; for depth see [links]." Hiding the quick path behind a wall of theory is a form of gatekeeping. I'd rather have someone run one shallow committee and then choose to go deeper than have them bounce off the docs and never try.

### Joe

We've seen this before. "Quick start" pages that promise 10 minutes usually assume either (a) the user already knows the domain, or (b) the tool is trivial. This methodology isn't trivial. In 2018 we tried a "5-minute quickstart" for a different sense-making framework; users ran it, got garbage output, and concluded the framework was broken. The failure wasn't the framework — it was the mismatch between the quickstart promise and what the framework actually requires. I'm not saying never do a Quickstart. I'm saying we need to be honest about what "under 10 minutes" delivers. If it's "you'll have a folder of files and a resolution you may not know how to interpret," say that. If we're not willing to say that, we shouldn't promise 10 minutes.

### Vic

What evidence do we have that a Quickstart would increase adoption or improve outcomes? I don't see usage data. I don't see A/B tests of "quickstart vs. full onboarding." I see a hypothesis: "lower barrier → more users → good." That's not evidence. The counter-hypothesis is: "quickstart → more users running shallow committees → more bad outcomes attributed to the methodology." We don't have data to distinguish. What I can say: a one-pager that gets someone to a real run in 10 minutes is *testable*. We could write a draft, time it, and see what gets lost. If the draft consistently produces committees that miss key tensions, we have a signal. If it doesn't, we have a different signal. My position is: don't commit to a Quickstart until we have at least one draft and one dry run with a naive user. Then decide.

### Tammy

The Quickstart isn't a standalone artifact — it's a node in the system. If we add it, we change the entry funnel. Right now the default path is "read, then run." A Quickstart creates a second path: "run fast, maybe read later." That has second-order effects. Some users will never leave the quick path; they'll run committees without the conceptual frame. Others will use the Quickstart as a hook and then deepen. The question is: does the quick path create positive or negative feedback loops? If quick-run users get value and then seek depth, we get growth. If quick-run users get confused or produce weak output and blame the method, we get reputational drag. I don't think we can know without defining what the one-pager actually contains and where it links. So I want the decision to be conditional: we're open to a Quickstart *if* it's designed to funnel toward the full frame, not replace it.

## Initial Positions Summary

| Member  | Stance | Confidence | Key Concern |
|---------|--------|------------|-------------|
| Maya    | Nay    | 4          | Political/credibility risk; overselling |
| Frankie | Aye    | 4          | Barrier too high; gatekeeping |
| Joe     | Nay    | 3          | Precedent: quickstarts overpromise |
| Vic     | Nay     | 2          | No evidence; need draft + test first |
| Tammy   | Aye (conditional) | 2 | Depends on design; funnel vs replace |

## Key Tensions Identified

1. **Accessibility vs. rigor** — Frankie: lower barrier serves mission. Maya/Joe: oversimplification risks credibility and past failure.
2. **Evidence vs. hypothesis** — Vic: no data that Quickstart helps; demand draft + test. Others: decision can be principled before data.
3. **Entry path as system** — Tammy: Quickstart changes the funnel; design matters. Others: binary Aye/Nay on "add one" vs. "don't add."

## Round 1

**Chair:** We have two Aye (Frankie, Tammy conditional), three Nay (Maya, Joe, Vic). Maya, you're highest confidence Nay. What would change your mind?

**Maya:** If the Quickstart came with an explicit "what you're missing" section — not buried, but upfront — and we committed to measuring misuse (e.g. "committee run without reading any essay" and tracking outcomes), I could move to a conditional Aye. I'm not moving to unqualified Aye. The risk is still that we're selling a simplified version as the real thing.

**Chair:** Frankie, you're high-confidence Aye. How do you respond to Joe's precedent?

**Frankie:** Joe's precedent is a different project. Our methodology has a single executable surface — run a committee. The "5-minute quickstart" that failed was for a framework with multiple modes and no clear "one thing to try." Here, the one thing is "/committee [topic]." We can get someone there in 10 minutes without lying. The nuance we skip is "why this works" and "what good looks like." We can say that on the page. I'm not asking for a Quickstart that pretends there's no depth. I'm asking for a door.

**Vic:** I'll sharpen my objection. I'm not against a Quickstart in principle. I'm against *deciding now* without a draft. If we vote Aye, we're committing to building something we haven't specified. If we vote Nay, we're not forever blocking it — we're saying "not yet; produce a draft and test it, then revisit." So my Nay is procedural: decide after evidence, not before.

**Tammy:** I'm with Vic on procedure but not on outcome. I'd support: "Aye, with the condition that the Quickstart is designed as a funnel (explicit links to depth, 'what you're missing' above the fold) and we iterate after first use." That's a conditional Aye. So we're not deciding "Quickstart yes/no" in the abstract; we're deciding "do we commit to producing a funnel-style Quickstart and revisiting after one round of use."

---

## Round 1 Analysis

Emerging split: Frankie and Tammy (conditional) favor a path to Yes; Maya, Joe, Vic favor No or "not yet." Vic's Nay is explicitly procedural (draft first). Tammy has moved toward a design-conditioned Aye. Next: test whether a motion that includes "funnel design + revisit" can attract Vic or Joe.

---

## Round 2

**Chair:** Tammy proposed a conditional Aye: Quickstart designed as funnel, revisit after first use. Frankie, does that satisfy your Aye?

**Frankie:** Yes. Funnel design is right. I don't want a dead-end quick path. So I'm Aye with Tammy's condition.

**Chair:** Vic, would "we commit to a draft that follows funnel design, and we don't publish until we've run one naive-user test" move you to Aye?

**Vic:** It would move me from Nay to abstain or weak Aye. My concern is committing before we have the draft. If the motion is "we will produce a draft meeting these criteria, and we decide publish/don't publish after one test," I can support that. So conditional Aye: we produce the thing; we test; we then decide to publish or revise. That's evidence-based.

**Joe:** I'm still Nay. My precedent stands: quickstarts overpromise. Even with "what you're missing," we're still promising "under 10 minutes." I'd need to see the draft to believe 10 minutes is achievable without cutting critical steps. So I'm Nay until draft exists — same as Vic's original position, but I'm not moving to conditional Aye because I think the risk of reputational damage is higher than Frankie allows.

**Maya:** I'll move to conditional Aye if the resolution states explicitly: (1) Quickstart includes upfront "what you're missing," (2) we track or at least acknowledge the risk of shallow-use attribution. I'm not willing to vote Aye on a vague "we'll do a funnel." I need those two in the implementation plan.

**Chair:** So we have: Frankie Aye (with funnel), Tammy Aye (funnel + revisit), Vic conditional Aye (draft → test → then publish), Maya conditional Aye (two safeguards). Joe remains Nay. If we frame the resolution as "Aye: we will produce a funnel-style Quickstart meeting [safeguards], test with one naive user, then decide publish/revise," do we have consensus?

**Joe:** I'm still Nay. I don't think we should commit to producing it until we've seen a draft. So I'm the lone Nay.

## Round 2 Analysis

Four members support a conditional Aye (produce draft with safeguards, test, then decide). Joe holds Nay: don't commit to producing until draft exists. Resolution will be PASSED with majority Aye, implementation plan capturing conditions.

---

## Final Consensus

- **Motion:** We will produce a one-page Quickstart designed as a funnel (explicit "what you're missing," links to depth), run one naive-user test, then decide whether to publish or revise. We do not promise "under 10 minutes" in the charter until the draft proves it.
- **Status:** DELIBERATION COMPLETE.
- **Votes:** Frankie Aye (4), Tammy Aye (4), Vic Aye (3), Maya Aye (3), Joe Nay (3).

---

## KEY TENSIONS IDENTIFIED

- **Accessibility vs. rigor:** Lowering the barrier serves adoption but risks overselling. Resolution: conditional commitment with funnel design and test.
- **Evidence vs. commitment:** Vic and Joe wanted evidence before commitment; majority accepted "produce draft → test → then publish" as evidence-gathering.
- **Precedent vs. context:** Joe's "quickstarts overpromise" weighed; differentiated by single executable surface and explicit safeguards.

## ASSUMPTIONS SURFACED

- That a 10-minute path is achievable without cutting critical steps (Joe disputed; resolution defers promise until draft exists).
- That "funnel" design will direct users toward depth (Tammy, Frankie; not proven).
- That one naive-user test is sufficient signal (Vic; accepted as minimum).

## EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

- One draft Quickstart meeting funnel + safeguards.
- One timed run with a naive user; document what was lost or confused.
- Decision to publish/revise after test.

## DECISION SPACE MAP

- **Optimize for adoption:** Aye with minimal conditions (Frankie).
- **Optimize for credibility:** Nay or heavy conditions (Maya, Joe).
- **Optimize for evidence:** Commit only after draft + test (Vic).
- **Optimize for system design:** Funnel and revisit (Tammy).
- **Resolution:** Conditional Aye — produce, test, then decide.

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

- Draft the one-page Quickstart with "what you're missing" above the fold and links to essays/artifacts.
- Run one naive-user test; record time and confusion points.
- Revisit publish/revise in a follow-up decision.
