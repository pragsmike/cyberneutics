resolution:
  date: "2026-02-22"
  topic: "Should the default committee run use the full 5-member roster, with a documented 'quick' 3-member variant as optional (rather than 5 as the only default)?"
  outcome: PASSED
  decision: "Aye. Document 5 as default and 3 as optional 'quick' variant with explicit trade-off and disclaimer that 3-member runs are unevaluated; recommend 5 for consequential decisions. Add one 3-vs-5 comparison to backlog."
  summary: |
    The committee voted 4 Aye, 1 Nay. Frankie, Tammy, Vic, and Joe (conditional) supported documenting the 3-member option with caveats; Maya remained Nay, arguing that putting 3 on the menu endorses a weaker process regardless of disclaimers. Implementation: update run guide/README with trade-off and disclaimer; add 3-vs-5 comparison to backlog.
