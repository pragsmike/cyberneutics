charter:
  goal: "Decide whether the default committee run should use the full 5-member roster, with a documented 'quick' 3-member variant as optional (rather than 5 as the only default)."
  context: |
    The committee skill currently defaults to all five roster members. A 'quick' 3-member mode is mentioned in the skill. The question is whether to document 3 as an optional default (e.g. 'quick' = 3 members) or keep 5 as the only default. Affects onboarding and run length. Resolution must include vote and confidence (1-4) per member for metacognition smoke test.
  success_criteria:
    - "Clear recommendation: 5 as default vs. 3 as optional default, with rationale"
    - "Trade-offs (coverage vs. speed) named"
  exit_conditions:
    - "Committee delivers resolution with votes and confidence"
