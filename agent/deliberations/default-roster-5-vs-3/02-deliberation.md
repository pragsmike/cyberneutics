# Phase 2: Deliberation

**Topic:** Should the default committee run use the full 5-member roster, with a documented "quick" 3-member variant as optional (rather than 5 as the only default)?  
**Protocol:** Robert's Rules; adversarial engagement.

---

## Opening Statements

### Maya

Documenting 3 as an optional default is a foot in the door for "good enough" deliberation. Once we say "you can run with 3," we're endorsing a product that's deliberately weaker. The methodology's value is in the *tension* between five propensities. Cut two and you're not running the same process — you're running a cheaper imitation. I'm not against a "quick" mode existing for power users who know what they're sacrificing. I'm against *documenting* it as a default option. That signals "3 is fine for real decisions," and it isn't. So: keep 5 as the only default. If someone wants 3, they can find it in the skill, but don't advertise it as equivalent.

### Frankie

Five is the full experience; three is a compromise for time or scope. Hiding the 3-member option behind "only for experts" is gatekeeping. If we document "default: 5; quick: 3" we're being honest: here's the full table, here's the smaller one. Users can choose. The risk isn't documentation — it's pretending 5 is the only way and then having people skip the methodology entirely because they don't have time for five. I'd rather they run 3 and get *some* adversarial coverage than run nothing. So Aye: document 5 as default, 3 as optional quick variant, with a clear "what you're giving up" note.

### Joe

We've never validated 3-member runs. The skill mentions "quick" but we don't have evidence that 3-member committees produce comparable decision-space coverage. In every other process design we've looked at, reducing group size changes dynamics — you lose critical tensions. So committing to "3 as documented option" without data is premature. I'd vote Aye only if we add a caveat: "3-member variant is experimental; we recommend 5 for consequential decisions." Without that, I'm Nay. Don't document 3 as a peer to 5 until we have at least one comparison (same topic, 3 vs 5, same rubric).

### Vic

What's the decision variable? "Document 3 as optional" — do we have usage data that people are asking for 3? Do we have evidence that 3-member runs underperform 5? I don't. So we're deciding in the dark. My position: document 3 as optional *with* a clear disclaimer that it's unevaluated, and add to the backlog "run one 3-vs-5 comparison." That's Aye with conditions. Pure Nay ("don't document at all") hides information. Pure Aye ("3 is fine") overclaims. Conditional Aye: document with disclaimer, then gather evidence.

### Tammy

From a systems view, two defaults (5 and 3) create two entry paths. Right now the system has one path: 5. Adding "3 as optional" doesn't remove 5; it adds a branch. The question is whether that branch creates confusion ("which should I use?") or clarity ("I have 10 minutes, I use 3"). I think clarity wins if we document the trade-off explicitly: "5 = full coverage; 3 = speed, less tension." So I'm Aye for documenting 3 as optional, with the trade-off stated. The failure mode is users thinking 3 and 5 are equivalent; we prevent that with words, not by hiding 3.

## Initial Positions Summary

| Member  | Stance | Confidence | Key Concern |
|---------|--------|------------|-------------|
| Maya    | Nay    | 4          | 3 as default option endorses "good enough" |
| Frankie | Aye    | 4          | Document both; gatekeeping to hide 3 |
| Joe     | Nay     | 2          | No validation of 3; need 3-vs-5 comparison first |
| Vic     | Aye (conditional) | 2 | Document with disclaimer; gather evidence |
| Tammy   | Aye    | 3          | Two paths with clear trade-off stated |

---

## Key Tensions Identified

1. **Documentation as endorsement** — Maya: documenting 3 = endorsing weak process. Frankie/Tammy: documenting = honesty, not endorsement.
2. **Evidence before commitment** — Joe, Vic: we haven't validated 3-member runs. Others: we can document with caveats.
3. **Single vs. dual default** — One path (5 only) vs. two paths (5 default, 3 quick) with explicit trade-off.

---

## Round 1

**Chair:** Three Aye (Frankie, Vic conditional, Tammy), one Nay (Maya), one Nay (Joe). Joe, you're low-confidence Nay. What would move you?

**Joe:** If the resolution included "3-member variant is unevaluated; we recommend 5 for consequential decisions" and a commitment to run at least one 3-vs-5 comparison, I'd move to conditional Aye. I'm not moving to unqualified Aye.

**Chair:** Maya, you're high-confidence Nay. What's your response to "document with caveats"?

**Maya:** Documenting with caveats still puts 3 on the menu. Once it's on the menu, people will use it for consequential decisions and point to our docs. The caveat won't be read. I've seen this in other projects — "experimental" becomes "supported" in user mental models. So I stay Nay. I'd only move if we *don't* document 3 as a default option at all — keep it in the skill for those who dig, but don't put it in the main run guide or README as a choice.

**Vic:** I'll sharpen: my conditional Aye is "document 3 as optional with strong disclaimer, add 3-vs-5 comparison to backlog." That's the same as Joe's ask. So Vic and Joe are aligned on condition. Maya is saying no documentation in main surfaces — that's a stronger Nay. We have a possible majority: Frankie, Tammy, Vic, Joe (if condition met) = 4 Aye with conditions. Maya lone Nay.

**Tammy:** I'm fine with the condition. Document 3 as optional, state the trade-off and "unevaluated; use 5 for consequential decisions," and add 3-vs-5 comparison to backlog. That's my Aye.

---

## Round 1 Analysis

Four members can support conditional Aye (document 3 with disclaimer + comparison commitment). Maya holds Nay: don't document 3 on main surfaces. Resolution will be PASSED with implementation plan capturing disclaimer and comparison.

---

## Round 2

**Chair:** Motion: We document the 3-member variant as an optional "quick" path with (1) explicit trade-off "5 = full coverage, 3 = speed / less tension," (2) disclaimer "3-member runs are unevaluated; we recommend 5 for consequential decisions," (3) commitment to add one 3-vs-5 comparison to the backlog. All in favor?

**Frankie:** Aye.  
**Tammy:** Aye.  
**Vic:** Aye.  
**Joe:** Aye (condition met).  
**Maya:** Nay. I don't agree that caveats solve the problem. I'm on the record.

**Chair:** Motion passes 4–1. Resolution: Aye with implementation plan.

---

## Final Consensus

- **Motion:** Document 5 as default, 3 as optional "quick" variant with trade-off and disclaimer; add 3-vs-5 comparison to backlog.
- **Status:** DELIBERATION COMPLETE.
- **Votes:** Frankie Aye (4), Tammy Aye (3), Vic Aye (3), Joe Aye (3), Maya Nay (4).

---

## KEY TENSIONS IDENTIFIED

- **Documentation as endorsement vs. honesty:** Maya: don't put 3 on main menu. Others: document with caveats.
- **Evidence:** Joe/Vic required disclaimer and comparison commitment; majority agreed.
- **User behavior:** Maya argued caveats get ignored; others accepted risk with clear wording.

## ASSUMPTIONS SURFACED

- That users read disclaimers (Maya disputed).
- That 3-member runs are under-specified until compared to 5 (Joe, Vic).
- That two documented paths reduce friction without equating 3 and 5 (Tammy, Frankie).

## EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

- One 3-vs-5 comparison (same topic, same rubric) to inform future documentation.

## DECISION SPACE MAP

- **Optimize for purity:** Nay — 5 only on main surfaces (Maya).
- **Optimize for access:** Aye — document 3 with caveats (Frankie, Tammy).
- **Optimize for evidence:** Conditional Aye — disclaimer + comparison (Joe, Vic).
- **Resolution:** Aye 4–1 with implementation plan.

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

- Update run guide / README: default 5, optional 3 with trade-off and disclaimer.
- Add backlog item: run one 3-vs-5 comparison on same topic, report findings.
