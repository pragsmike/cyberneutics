charter:
  goal: "Evaluate the 'Evaluating Deliberative Architectures' research program for completeness, consistency, and weaknesses."
  context: "The user has expanded `evaluating-deliberative-architectures.md` into a formal 4-phase empirical research design called the Black Swan Hindsight Framework. It uses historical and constructed scenarios to evaluate different architectures on Anticipation, Epistemic Humility, and Decision Landscape Topology. We need to assess if it's documented well enough to be executed by competent researchers, if it's self-consistent, what its weaknesses are, and how it could be improved."
  success_criteria:
    - Assess documentation completeness for execution.
    - Evaluate internal consistency of metrics and protocols.
    - Identify specific weaknesses or unaddressed failure modes.
    - Recommend concrete improvements or next steps.
  exit_conditions:
    - Five independent positions generated based on character propensities.
    - Structured debate highlighting tensions and assumptions.
    - Synthesis producing a Decision Space Map and Recommendations.
  deliverable_format: "Resolution Artifact + Decision Space Map"
