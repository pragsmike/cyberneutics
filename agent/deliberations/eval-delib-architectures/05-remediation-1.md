# Remediation Round 1 (Motion to Recommit)

The committee acknowledges the receipt of two independent evaluations (`04-evaluation-1.md` and `04-evaluation-2.md`). The user has already amended the research program document to address several of the committee's initial findings, notably demoting Metric 3, reweighting the corpus, and adding a bias calibration protocol. 

The latest evaluation accurately flags three remaining gaps in our deliberation:

1. **Evidentiary collapse on Evaluator Bias**: The committee accepted Maya's claim that the evaluator LLM would biasedly score "eloquence over anticipation" without demanding empirical proof or a testing mechanism.
   *Decision*: **Accept**. The author's new "Evaluator Stylistic Bias Protocol" perfectly addresses this by converting our assumed fact into a testable hypothesis. We will formally adopt this amendment in the deliberation.
2. **Missing mechanism for Tammy's Topology critique**: Tammy asserted that static prompts cannot map decision topology, but failed to explain *why* mechanically (temperature-induced variance vs interactive boundary probing).
   *Decision*: **Accept**. Tammy will explicitly trace this mechanical difference in Round 3.
3. **Unacknowledged trade-off in Corpus Reweighting**: The committee reweighted the corpus heavily toward "Constructed Scenarios" without acknowledging that this sacrifices the framework's unique methodological claim to "historical ground truth."
   *Decision*: **Accept**. We will formally acknowledge this core trade-off in Round 3 and the final resolution.

The committee will now proceed to Round 3 to address these points.
