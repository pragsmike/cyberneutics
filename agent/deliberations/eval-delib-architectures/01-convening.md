# Convening Record

- **Date**: 2026-02-26
- **Selection Strategy**: Standard roster from `agent/roster.md`
- **Rationale**: The standard adversarial committee provides optimal coverage for evaluating a research program. Maya will check for misaligned incentives in the evaluation protocol; Vic will scrutinize the validity of the proposed epistemic metrics; Joe will evaluate the historical case methodology; Frankie will assess whether the framework stays true to the mission of mitigating wicked problems; Tammy will analyze the cascading effects of the 7-condition run budget and integration with the prior scheme.
- **Composition Notes**: Maya and Vic will likely form an alliance scrutinizing the "Blind Evaluation" protocol for loopholes. Frankie and Tammy will likely debate the utility of the constructed cases vs the historical ones. Joe's propensity for continuity will heavily test the "Contamination Probe" mitigations.

Outcome: Committee convened. See `01-roster.md`.
