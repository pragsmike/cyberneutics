resolution:
  date: "2026-02-26"
  topic: "Evaluating Deliberative Architectures"
  outcome: "PASSED (Fully Ratified)"
  decision: "Execute the amended research program. The newly added calibration protocols and separated reporting tables resolve the committee's major structural concerns."
  summary: "After a remediation round incorporating independent evaluations and the author's amendments, the committee formally endorses the research program. The addition of the Evaluator Stylistic Bias Protocol successfully converts an unfalsifiable risk into a testable calibration step. The separation of Historical and Constructed cases into distinct reporting tables explicitly acknowledges the trade-off between contamination-free structural testing and messy historical ground truth. Finally, the demotion of the static Topology metric correctly prevents sampling variance from being mischaracterized as decision boundary mapping."
  implementation_plan:
    - "Execute the Phase 1 Evaluator Bias Calibration Protocol before scoring cases."
    - "Maintain strict separation between Historical and Constructed case reporting (Tables 1a/1b)."
    - "Treat any convergence/divergence in the dual C2 runs strictly as qualitative observation, not topological proof."

# Resolution: Evaluating Deliberative Architectures (Amended)

The Black Swan Hindsight Framework, as amended on 2026-02-26, represents a rigorous, executable research design. The committee's initial concerns regarding knowledge contamination, evaluator bias, and statistical invalidity have been systematically addressed through structural amendments.

Key ratifications from the Remediation Round:
1. **Evaluator Bias is now empirical**: Rather than resting on an untested assumption of LLM bias toward "eloquence," the new calibration protocol guarantees this bias will be tested and accounted for prior to execution.
2. **Corpus Trade-offs are honest**: The framework correctly bifurcates Historical cases (high reality, high contamination risk) and Constructed cases (pure structural recognition, artificial ground truth), reporting them independently.
3. **Topology mechanism clarified**: The committee confirms that variance on a static prompt measures model sampling noise, not decision topology. The demotion of Metric 3 to a qualitative observation is mathematically sound.

The research program is cleared for execution.
