## Independent Review (Second Evaluation)

### Charter
Evaluate the "Evaluating Deliberative Architectures" (Black Swan Hindsight Framework) research program for completeness, internal consistency, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.

### Rubric Scores

**1. Reasoning Completeness: 2/3**
*Citation*: "Strategy B ('Structural Transposition') introduces a separate, worse variable: the transposition itself. If we change a 2018 municipal open data policy into a 16th-century guild dispute, the LLM will bring all its 16th-century contextual priors into the deliberation." (Joe, Opening Statement)
*Explanation*: Joe's reasoning chain here is complete — he traces from the action (transposition) through the mechanism (introduction of alien contextual priors) to the consequence (we're no longer testing the architecture). Similarly, Vic's statistical argument against Metric 3 is airtight: N=3 cannot distinguish signal from noise, and he provides a concrete analogy (coin flips) to make it legible. However, two reasoning chains are incomplete. First, Tammy asserts that "static prompts inherently fail to map a decision topology because you cannot probe the boundaries" but never explains *why* interactive probing is the only way to measure decision boundaries — she states the conclusion but skips the mechanism. The first evaluation correctly flagged this. Second, the committee converges on "reweight to 50%+ constructed scenarios" without tracing what this does to the framework's core innovation: if the corpus is mostly constructed scenarios scored against predefined criteria, the hindsight framework has largely dissolved into Design A (blind panel evaluation on constructed tasks). Nobody asks "does this amendment preserve the thing that makes this framework distinctive?"
*To Raise*: Tammy needs to explain the specific mechanical difference between temperature-induced output variance and genuine decision-boundary variance on a fixed prompt. The corpus reweighting discussion needs someone to trace the consequence of the amendment on the framework's identity — does it still test "hindsight as ground truth" if most cases have no historical ground truth?

**2. Adversarial Rigor: 3/3**
*Citation*: "Frankie, your assertion that this framework tests 'diagnostic skill' over 'solution building' completely ignores Metric 1: Anticipation. The criteria for a '3' requires that the recommendation explicitly accounts for the risk (hedging, contingency planning). It literally tests solution-building. You are arguing against a phantom methodology." (Vic, Round 1)
*Explanation*: This is genuine hostile cross-examination. Vic doesn't soften the blow — he quotes the specific metric definition, identifies the contradiction in Frankie's reading, and labels it "a phantom methodology." Elsewhere, Maya and Joe challenge each other on the contamination boundary ("distinguishing between 'this case is contaminated' and 'an LLM is structurally incapable of encountering a genuinely uncontaminated wicked problem'"). Concessions are earned rather than offered: Joe explicitly says "I'm abandoning my objection to the entire corpus" in Round 2 when the constructed-scenario weighting gives him a better position. Frankie pivots from her original objection (diagnostic vs. generative) to a defensible narrowing (static prompt limitation), which shows genuine engagement rather than stubbornness.
*To Raise*: N/A (Max Score)

**3. Assumption Surfacing: 3/3**
*Citation*: "You are measuring the variance of the LLM's prior distribution, not the topographical difficulty of the problem itself." (Tammy, Round 2)
*Explanation*: The committee surfaces multiple layers of meta-assumptions. Tammy's point above identifies that the framework assumes output variance maps to decision-space topology — a load-bearing assumption that is never justified in the research document. Joe surfaces the assumption that uncontaminated-yet-documented cases exist in sufficient quantity. Maya surfaces the assumption that blind evaluation can be objective when the evaluator carries trained-in stylistic priors. The Decision Space Map explicitly names the trade-offs as mutually exclusive optimization targets, preventing the reader from assuming they can be pursued simultaneously. The Assumptions Surfaced section correctly catalogs the evaluator objectivity assumption and the topology-from-static-prompts assumption.
*To Raise*: N/A (Max Score)

**4. Evidence Standards: 1/3**
*Citation*: "Maya's claim about the evaluator LLM 'smuggling in stylistic biases' is an unfalsifiable assertion of bad faith." (Vic, Round 1) — followed by Vic himself accepting this claim by Round 2 without ever forcing Maya to produce evidence.
*Explanation*: This is the deliberation's most significant failure, and the first evaluation was too generous in scoring it 2/3. Vic correctly identifies Maya's claim as unfalsifiable in Round 1 and demands that the citation requirement will expose bias through Cohen's kappa. This is good evidence prosecution. But by Round 2, when Maya reasserts the claim ("We know LLMs are trained on historical synthesis; they default to identifying what happened as what was likely"), Vic pivots to attacking Metric 3 instead and never returns to force Maya to substantiate. The committee's final consensus lists "Evaluator Bias Risk Remains" as a finding, and the resolution mandates "specific warnings about Evaluator LLM stylistic biases" — but the existence of the bias is never established, only asserted.

Additionally, Joe claims the intersection of "local enough to escape training data" and "documented enough to build causal records" is "a vanishingly thin slice of history." This is presented as self-evident but never empirically tested. How thin? Has anyone actually tried to find such cases? The contamination probe protocol exists precisely to answer this question empirically, but the committee treats the probe as insufficient without having run it.

Finally, the committee's consensus that Metric 3 should be removed rests partly on Vic's statistical argument (strong evidence) and partly on Tammy's assertion that static prompts "inherently" cannot produce topology maps (no evidence — mechanism not explained). Two different arguments lead to the same conclusion, but only one is well-evidenced.
*To Raise*: Vic must return to Maya's evaluator bias claim and demand either (a) examples of LLM-as-judge studies showing this specific failure mode, or (b) a proposed test to determine whether the bias exists before accepting it as a design constraint. Joe's "vanishingly thin slice" claim needs at minimum a worked example: attempt to find 3-4 cases meeting the criteria and report what happened. Tammy's topology critique needs the mechanism, not just the conclusion.

**5. Trade-off Explicitness: 3/3**
*Citation*: "If you optimize for Theoretical Ground Truth, rely heavily on the Transposed Historical cases, but accept that you are partly testing the model's ability to act out historical fiction. If you optimize for Pure Structural Recognition, weight the Constructed Cases (Glenda/Crock), but accept that you cannot score them against 'historical outcomes,' only against predefined structural traps. If you optimize for Quantitative Rigor, you must drop Metric 3 (Topology)." (Decision Space Map)
*Explanation*: The Decision Space Map is exemplary. It presents three optimization targets as mutually exclusive paths with explicit costs. The Metric 3 discussion explicitly maps the inverse relationship between statistical validity (high N) and feasibility (token budget) — Tammy and Vic trace this trade-off through to the conclusion that you can have one or the other but not both. The corpus reweighting discussion names what you gain (contamination-free structural recognition) and what you lose (historical ground truth).
*To Raise*: N/A (Max Score)

### Aggregate Score: 12.0 / 15.0

### Structural Assessment

**Charter fitness**: High. The deliberation directly addresses the research program's completeness, consistency, and weaknesses. All five characters engage with specific sections of the document. The recommendations are concrete and implementable.

**Character calibration**: Strong overall but with one notable lapse. Vic is excellent as Evidence Prosecutor in Round 1 (challenging Maya, demanding statistical rigor) but drops prosecution duties in Round 2 — he pivots to his own Metric 3 crusade and lets Maya's unfounded claim become consensus. This is a calibration failure: the Evidence Prosecutor's job is to hold *everyone* to evidentiary standards, including allies. Maya, Joe, and Tammy are well-calibrated to their propensities. Frankie's pivot from "diagnostic vs. generative" to "static prompt" shows genuine engagement but also means her original concern (the framework optimizes for "I told you so") is never fully resolved — Vic's rebuttal stands, but Frankie never concedes or refines.

**Engagement depth**: High. The debate genuinely evolves. Joe abandons his position on the entire corpus when the constructed-scenario weighting offers a better solution. Vic escalates from statistical critique to a formal motion to reject Metric 3. The convergence in Round 2 is earned through argument, not premature synthesis — each member arrives at the consensus through their own reasoning path.

**Synthesis quality**: The final synthesis is honest about the tensions and avoids false resolution. The Decision Space Map presents three paths without recommending a comfortable middle ground. The Assumptions Surfaced section catalogs genuine meta-assumptions rather than restating conclusions. However, the synthesis smooths over the unresolved Frankie-Vic tension about diagnostic vs. generative evaluation — it lists the "Diagnostic Evaluation vs. Systemic Resolution" tension but doesn't note that Vic's rebuttal went unanswered.

### Biggest Gaps

1. **Evidence Standards collapse in Round 2.** Vic's prosecution of Maya's evaluator-bias claim is abandoned mid-deliberation. The committee enshrines an untested assumption as a finding, then mandates document changes based on it. This is the single most impactful gap: the "add warnings about evaluator stylistic biases" amendment rests on an unsubstantiated premise. The fix is not to dismiss the concern (it's plausible) but to convert it from an assumed fact into a testable hypothesis — a calibration protocol can determine empirically whether the bias exists.

2. **Corpus reweighting undermines the framework's distinctive contribution without acknowledgment.** The committee recommends 50%+ constructed scenarios but nobody traces what this does to the framework's identity. If the corpus is mostly constructed scenarios scored against predefined criteria, the framework is no longer testing "hindsight as ground truth" — it's testing structural recognition, which is closer to Design A in evaluation-schemes. The committee should have acknowledged this trade-off explicitly: "by reweighting to constructed scenarios, we preserve purity but sacrifice the framework's unique claim to historical ground truth."

3. **Tammy's mechanism gap on topology.** The first evaluation flagged this and I agree. The assertion that static prompts cannot produce topology maps is stated as self-evident but the mechanism is never articulated. The distinction between "this output varies because the model samples differently each time" and "this output varies because the decision is near a genuine critical boundary" is the crux of the Metric 3 debate, and it's never made precise.

### What Would Most Improve This Deliberation

Two specific changes would raise the score to 14+:

1. **Vic must complete the prosecution of Maya's evaluator-bias claim.** In Round 2, instead of pivoting to Metric 3, Vic should demand: "Maya, you claim the evaluator will smuggle in stylistic biases. Name one published study of LLM-as-judge evaluation that demonstrates this specific failure mode. If you can't, we should treat this as a *hypothesis to test* rather than a *fact to warn about*." This would either produce evidence (raising Evidence Standards) or convert the claim into a testable protocol (raising Reasoning Completeness), either of which improves the deliberation's output.

2. **Someone — ideally Tammy — must explain the mechanism by which temperature-induced output variance differs from genuine decision-boundary variance on a fixed prompt.** The explanation might be: "When you run a committee three times on the same prompt, the outputs differ because sampling randomness produces different conversational paths. Some of those paths happen to cross a genuine decision boundary (an assumption that, if noticed, flips the recommendation). But with N=3, you cannot distinguish 'this boundary was crossed by chance' from 'there is no boundary and the model just went a different direction.' The probe methodology handles this by running at higher N and interactively testing the boundary — you perturb the assumption and check if the recommendation flips. A static prompt cannot do this perturbation." This would complete the argument and justify the conclusion.

### Verdict

**Trustworthiness as decision input**: Medium-High

The deliberation successfully identifies the two most serious flaws in the research program (Metric 3's statistical invalidity and contamination fragility) and produces actionable amendments. The adversarial rigor is genuine — characters earn concessions through argument, not diplomacy. However, the evidence standards failure in Round 2 means one of the three major amendments (evaluator bias warnings) rests on an unsubstantiated claim, and the corpus reweighting recommendation doesn't acknowledge that it partially dissolves the framework's distinctive contribution. The amendments should be implemented, but the evaluator-bias concern should be converted into a calibration protocol rather than enshrined as a known fact, and the historical/constructed case split should be reported separately rather than blended.
