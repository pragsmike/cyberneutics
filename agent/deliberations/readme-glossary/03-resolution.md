  outcome: PASSED
  decision: "Aye. Add a minimal glossary (5–10 terms) in README or a dedicated doc linked from README; definitions drawn from palgebra/reference and key artifacts; review when we add new terms."

    The committee voted 5–0 Aye. All members supported a minimal glossary with conditions: tie to source of truth (palgebra, artifacts), review trigger when we add terms. Frankie and Tammy emphasized lower barrier; Maya and Joe accepted with the source-of-truth condition.
