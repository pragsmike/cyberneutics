  biggest_gaps:
    - "Round 1 is brief; one exchange (Chair to Maya) then consensus. Could use one more challenge (e.g. Vic to Joe on 'source of truth')."
    - "Trade-offs (README length vs. dedicated doc) stated but not deeply compared."
  recommendations:
    - "Add one round of direct challenge (e.g. evidence or systems character pushes back on maintenance concern)."

## Independent Review (baseline run)

Verdict: **Medium**. Reasoning complete, assumptions surfaced; adversarial rigor and trade-off explicitness could be stronger. Sum 12 below threshold 13; optional remediation.
