charter:
  goal: "Decide whether to add a short glossary of key terms (e.g. 'fan', 'funnel', 'meta-d'') to the README or a dedicated doc."
  context: |
    The methodology uses several terms (fan, funnel, meta-d', deliberation, resolution) that may be unfamiliar. A glossary could lower friction for new readers. Trade-off: README length vs. discoverability; dedicated doc vs. one-stop README. Resolution must include vote and confidence (1-4) per member.
  success_criteria:
    - "Clear recommendation: add in README, dedicated doc, or neither"
    - "Trade-offs named"
  exit_conditions:
    - "Committee delivers resolution with votes and confidence"
  deliverable_format: "Resolution Artifact + Decision Space Map"
