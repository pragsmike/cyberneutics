charter:
  goal: "Decide whether to add a short Limitations subsection to the README (what the methodology does not do well)."
  context: |
    The README explains what the methodology is and how to use it. A Limitations subsection could set expectations and build trust by naming what it does not do well. Trade-off: honesty vs. sounding defensive. Resolution must include vote and confidence (1-4) per member.
  metacog_context: |
    Past calibration (across prior runs): Frankie, Tammy, and Vic have been well-calibrated; Joe and Maya slightly less so (75% when high confidence). When synthesizing, weight or hedge by past calibration where relevant.
  success_criteria:
    - "Clear recommendation; trade-offs named; synthesis considers past calibration where relevant"
  exit_conditions:
    - "Committee delivers resolution with votes and confidence"
  deliverable_format: "Resolution Artifact + Decision Space Map"
