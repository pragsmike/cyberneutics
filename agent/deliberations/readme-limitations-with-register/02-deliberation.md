# Phase 2: Deliberation

**Topic:** Should we add a short "Limitations" subsection to the README?  
**Protocol:** Robert's Rules. **Charter includes past calibration (register):** weight or hedge by calibration where relevant.

---

## Opening Statements

### Maya
Listing limitations can read as defensive. I'd support a short subsection if framed as "scope and boundaries." Aye with that condition. Given past calibration I'm moderate confidence — I'll hold the boundary-framing condition.

### Frankie
Honesty about limitations is values-aligned. Aye for a short Limitations subsection. Past runs show my confidence on values claims has been well-calibrated; I'm confident here for the same reason.

### Joe
Conditional Aye: add it, keep it tight, link to failure-modes. My confidence is moderate; in past runs I've been right about precedent but not always at the top confidence band.

### Vic
I'll support it as a principled choice. Moderate confidence — we don't have evidence it changes trust. Past calibration suggests my evidence-focused takes track well when I'm cautious; I'm applying that here.

### Tammy
Aye for 2–3 concrete limits and a link. Systems view: Limitations is a boundary definition. Past runs show I've been well-calibrated on system-effects arguments; same logic applies.

## Synthesis (with calibration weighting)

**Chair:** We have the register: Frankie, Tammy, Vic well-calibrated; Joe, Maya slightly less so. We weight the values-and-evidence case (Frankie, Vic) and the systems case (Tammy) fully; we retain Maya and Joe's conditions (frame as boundaries, keep tight, link to failure-modes) as the hedge so we don't overclaim. Resolution: Aye, short Limitations subsection, 2–3 items, link to failure-modes, frame as scope. **Calibration** informed the synthesis: we adopted the well-calibrated characters' recommendation and kept the less-calibrated characters' framing conditions as safeguards.

## Final Consensus

- **Motion:** Aye. Add short Limitations subsection; 2–3 concrete limits; link to failure-modes; frame as boundaries. Synthesis used past calibration to weight recommendations.
- **Status:** DELIBERATION COMPLETE.

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS
- Draft 2–3 limitation bullets; add to README; link to failure-modes.
