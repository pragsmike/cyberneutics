resolution:
  date: "2026-02-24"
  topic: "Should we add a short Limitations subsection to the README (what the methodology does not do well)?"
  outcome: PASSED
  decision: "Aye. Add a short Limitations subsection (2–3 concrete items) to the README; link to failure-modes essay. Frame as scope and boundaries. Synthesis weighted past calibration: well-calibrated characters' recommendation adopted; framing conditions from others retained as hedge."
  summary: |
    Unanimous Aye. Deliberation used the metacog register to weight Frankie, Tammy, and Vic's recommendation (well-calibrated) and retain Maya and Joe's framing conditions (boundaries, tight scope) as the hedge. Same outcome as baseline with explicit calibration weighting in the resolution.
