# Phase 2: Deliberation

**Topic:** Should we add a short "Limitations" subsection to the README (e.g. what the methodology does not do well)?  
**Protocol:** Robert's Rules; adversarial engagement.

---

## Opening Statements

### Maya
Listing limitations can read as defensive — "here's why we're not dangerous." But not listing them lets critics fill the gap. I'd support a short subsection if it's framed as "scope and boundaries" not "here are our weaknesses." Nay if it's a laundry list of caveats; Aye if it's 2–3 concrete boundaries (e.g. "not a replacement for human judgment; not empirically validated at scale").

### Frankie
Honesty about limitations is values-aligned. The failure-modes essay already does this; the README should signal it too so new readers see we're not overselling. Aye for a short Limitations subsection that points to the essay and names 2–3 concrete limits. Defensive is when we hide; naming limits is integrity.

### Joe
Other methodology projects that added "limitations" sections often did it after being criticized. Doing it proactively is better. I'm conditional Aye: add it, but keep it tight (3–5 bullets) and link to the full failure-modes doc. Don't let it become a dumping ground for every caveat.

### Vic
What evidence do we have that a Limitations subsection changes behavior or trust? We don't have A/B data. I'll support it as a principled choice — transparency — but I'm moderate confidence. Aye for a short subsection with concrete limits (not vague "we're not perfect"); make it falsifiable so we can revisit if it doesn't help.

### Tammy
From a systems view, a Limitations subsection is a boundary definition. It shapes who adopts and how. Without it, the boundary is implicit. With it, we're explicit. That can reduce misuse (people applying the method where it doesn't fit). I'm Aye for 2–3 concrete limits and a link to more. Trade-off: we might deter some users; we're betting honesty attracts the right ones.

## Round 1 and Consensus

**Chair:** All five Aye or conditional Aye. Motion: Add a short "Limitations" subsection (2–3 concrete items, link to failure-modes essay). Passes 5–0.

## Final Consensus

- **Motion:** Aye. Add short Limitations subsection to README; 2–3 concrete limits; link to failure-modes essay.
- **Status:** DELIBERATION COMPLETE.

## KEY TENSIONS IDENTIFIED
- Honesty vs. optics (Frankie/Maya). Resolution: frame as scope, not weakness list.

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS
- Draft 2–3 limitation bullets; add to README; link to failure-modes.
