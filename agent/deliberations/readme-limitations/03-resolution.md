resolution:
  date: "2026-02-24"
  topic: "Should we add a short 'Limitations' subsection to the README (e.g. what the methodology does not do well)?"
  outcome: PASSED
  decision: "Aye. Add a short Limitations subsection (2–3 concrete items) to the README; link to the failure-modes essay for full treatment."
  summary: |
    Unanimous Aye. Committee agreed that naming limitations is integrity- and scope-setting; keep it short, concrete, and linked to failure-modes. Trade-off (honesty vs. sounding defensive) resolved by framing as boundaries.
  implementation_plan:
    - action: "Draft 2–3 concrete limitation bullets (e.g. not a replacement for human judgment; not validated at scale)."
    - action: "Add subsection to README; link to failure-modes essay."
