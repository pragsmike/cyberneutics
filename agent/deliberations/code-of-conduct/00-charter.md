charter:
  goal: "Decide whether to add a Code of Conduct (CoC) to the repository."
  context: |
    The repo is open-source (CC BY-SA 4.0 essays, MIT code). There is no Code of Conduct currently. Many projects adopt a minimal CoC (e.g. Contributor Covenant) to signal inclusivity; others avoid one. CoCs have been weaponized in some communities. This run is also used for comparison with a CJT-style independent vote on the same question.
  success_criteria:
    - "Clear recommendation: Aye or Nay with rationale"
    - "Trade-offs and enforcement implications named"
  exit_conditions:
    - "Committee delivers resolution with votes"
