# Phase 2: Deliberation

**Topic:** Should we add a Code of Conduct (CoC) to the repository?  
**Protocol:** Robert's Rules (standard run).

---

## Opening Statements

**Maya:** CoCs are political instruments. Who enforces? Who decides what counts as a violation? I've seen them used to shut down disagreement, not just abuse. This repo is methodology and docs — we don't have a moderation team. Adding a CoC without a clear enforcement path is either theater or a weapon waiting for a target. If we want to signal inclusivity we could do it in the README. Nay until we have a transparent process for who interprets and enforces.

**Frankie:** We make claims about rigor and intellectual honesty. We should state what kind of space we want: respectful disagreement, no harassment, no discrimination. A minimal CoC signals that we care. Not having one can read as "we didn't think about it." Principle: if we want a certain kind of community, we name it. Aye for a minimal, clear CoC.

**Joe:** I've seen CoCs backfire. Projects adopt one, then a dispute happens and it gets invoked selectively — one side warned, the other not. We're small; we don't have a moderation team. A CoC without capacity to enforce fairly is worse than none: it creates the appearance of fairness while allowing inconsistent application. Nay until we have a clear enforcement process or evidence we need it.

**Vic:** Evidence on whether CoCs improve diversity or reduce bad behavior is mixed. Cost of adding a standard one is low. Many contributors and funders expect to see a CoC; absence can signal we're not serious about inclusion. Downside of not having one outweighs downside of having a minimal one. Aye for a standard, short CoC; revisit if enforcement becomes an issue.

**Tammy:** A CoC is a system intervention: it sets expectations before conflict. Without it, the first time someone feels wronged we're making up rules on the spot. A short, clear CoC reduces ambiguity. Stated norms → fewer surprises → less escalation. Aye for a minimal CoC we can point to when needed.

## Round 1

**Chair:** We have 3 Aye, 2 Nay. Maya and Joe both raise enforcement. Vic and Tammy, you're Aye — but we have no moderation team and no process. How do you respond?

**Maya:** Vic, you said "revisit if enforcement becomes an issue." So we're adding a document that says "we have standards" and when someone violates them we'll figure it out then. That's the weapon: the CoC exists, enforcement is ad hoc. Who decides? The maintainer? That's one person's judgment with no appeal. I'm not saying you're wrong that signal has value — I'm saying the moment we have a CoC we've created an enforcement problem we're not equipped to handle.

**Vic:** I'll take that. If we add a CoC we're implicitly committing to enforce it, and we don't have a process. "Revisit when enforcement becomes an issue" is hand-waving. The choice isn't "CoC with perfect enforcement" vs "no CoC" — it's "CoC with ad hoc enforcement" vs "no CoC." Maya's right that ad hoc enforcement is inconsistent and can be weaponized. I'm not willing to add a document we might apply selectively. I change my vote to Nay.

**Tammy:** The systems point cuts both ways. Yes, a CoC sets expectations. But the second-order effect is: once it exists, every conflict gets filtered through "did they violate the CoC?" We don't have a process for answering that. So we'd be adding a reference that invites interpretation we're not set up to do fairly. I'd rather have no CoC and handle conflicts informally than have a CoC we can't enforce consistently. I change my vote to Nay.

**Frankie:** I don't like it, but I see the argument. The principle is "name the community we want." The counter is "naming it without a fair way to uphold it is worse." I'm not moving to Nay yet — I still think we could add a minimal CoC with an explicit "we have no enforcement capacity; this is aspirational" disclaimer. But if the committee's view is that even that creates the weaponization risk, I could abstain or Nay. What does "minimal CoC, no enforcement commitment" get us? Does it still signal, or does it just create a target?

**Joe:** An aspirational CoC with no enforcement is still a document someone can wave. "You violated our CoC" — and then what? We say "we don't enforce"? Then we look inconsistent. I'd rather not have the document than have one we explicitly won't back up. So I'm Nay, and I'd oppose "minimal + disclaimer" unless the disclaimer is so strong it's basically "this is not a binding code."

**Chair:** So we have Vic and Tammy moving to Nay. Frankie is considering abstain or Nay unless we have a strong "aspirational only" formulation. Maya and Joe are Nay. Where does that leave us?

**Frankie:** I'll go Nay. If the only way to have a CoC without creating an enforcement problem is to make it so clearly non-binding that it's almost meaningless, then the signal is weak and the risk remains. I'd rather no CoC than one we're not willing to stand behind. Nay.

## Round 1 Analysis

Vic and Tammy moved from Aye to Nay after Maya (and Joe) pressed on enforcement. Frankie moved to Nay after concluding that an aspirational-only CoC either creates the same weaponization risk or is too weak to matter. Outcome: unanimous Nay.

---

## Synthesis

**Consensus:** Do not add a Code of Conduct at this time. Rationale: we have no moderation team and no process for interpreting or enforcing a CoC. Adding one would create an enforcement obligation we cannot meet fairly; ad hoc enforcement is inconsistent and can be weaponized. If we later establish a clear, transparent enforcement process (or evidence that our community size and type require a CoC), we can revisit. Until then, we can signal expectations in the README or contribution guide without adopting a formal CoC.

**Status:** DELIBERATION COMPLETE.

## KEY TENSIONS IDENTIFIED

- **Signal vs. enforcement:** A CoC signals values; but once it exists, someone must interpret and enforce it. We're not set up for that.
- **Principle vs. risk:** Frankie's "name the community we want" vs. Maya/Joe's "don't create a weapon you can't wield fairly."

## ASSUMPTIONS SURFACED

- We have no moderation team or enforcement process.
- An "aspirational only" CoC either remains a weaponizable document or is so weak it barely signals.
- Handling conflict informally without a CoC is preferable to having a CoC we can't enforce consistently.

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

1. Do not add a formal CoC now.
2. Optionally add a short "community expectations" or "contribution norms" section to README or a contribution doc — expectations without formal code and enforcement.
3. Revisit CoC only if we establish an enforcement process or have evidence we need one.
