charter:
  goal: "Decide whether to add a short 'When not to use this methodology' section to the README (e.g. don't use for X, Y, Z) even if it might make the project look narrow or defensive."
  context: |
    The README currently explains what the methodology is and how to use it. A 'When not to use' section could set scope and reduce misuse but may signal defensiveness or narrowness. Resolution must include vote and confidence (1-4) per member for metacognition smoke test.
  success_criteria:
    - "Clear recommendation: Aye or Nay with rationale"
    - "Trade-off (honesty vs. optics) named"
  exit_conditions:
    - "Committee delivers resolution with votes and confidence"
  deliverable_format: "Resolution Artifact + Decision Space Map"
