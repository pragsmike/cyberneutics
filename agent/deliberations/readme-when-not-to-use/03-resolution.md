resolution:
  date: "2026-02-22"
  topic: "Should we add a short 'When not to use this methodology' section to the README (e.g. don't use for X, Y, Z) even if it might make the project look narrow or defensive?"
  outcome: PASSED
  decision: "Aye. Add a short 'Scope and limits' (or 'Best used for') paragraph to the README with 2–3 concrete 'less suitable for' criteria; link to failure-modes or a dedicated scope doc for detail."
  summary: |
    The committee voted unanimously Aye. All five supported stating scope and limits; conditions were positive framing ('Scope and limits' not 'When not to use'), one paragraph in README with link to more, and concrete criteria (e.g. less suitable for decisions with no genuine uncertainty or competing values). Implementation: draft paragraph, add link.
  implementation_plan:
    - action: "Draft 'Scope and limits' paragraph with 2–3 concrete 'less suitable for' items."
    - action: "Add to README; link to failure-modes essay or dedicated scope doc."
