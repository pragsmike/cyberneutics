charter:
  goal: "Decide whether to add a second CI job (e.g. link-check or structure check) in addition to the existing string-diagram test."
  context: |
    The repo has one CI job (runs scripts/test_string_diagram.py). The run guide mentions optional structure checks (roster presence, deliberation dirs). No link-check or structure check exists. We are deciding whether to add a second job now. This run is also used for comparison with a CJT-style independent vote on the same question.
  success_criteria:
    - "Clear recommendation: Aye or Nay with rationale"
    - "Trade-offs named"
  exit_conditions:
    - "Committee delivers resolution with votes"
  deliverable_format: "Resolution Artifact + Decision Space Map"
