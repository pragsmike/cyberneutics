# Convening

**Date:** 2026-02-22  
**Selection strategy:** Standard roster from agent/roster.md  
**Rationale:** Full roster needed for a methodological question that touches theory (CJT), process design (independence, voting), and documentation. Vic will pressure claims about p and competence; Joe will cite formalization attempts that overreached; Maya will question who benefits from "correcting for" a theorem; Frankie will guard against diluting the deliberative ideal; Tammy will trace effects of any process change.  
**Composition notes:** Vic×Joe may align on "don't claim CJT without evidence of competence"; Maya×Frankie will tension over whether formalizing is intellectual honesty or institutional capture. Tammy will complicate any "just add a vote" move with second-order effects.  
**Outcome:** Committee convened. See 01-roster.md.
