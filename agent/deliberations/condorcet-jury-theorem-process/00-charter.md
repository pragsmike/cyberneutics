charter:
  goal: "Decide what, if anything, to change in the committee design or documentation to 'correct for' or explicitly relate to Condorcet's jury theorem."
  context: |
    Condorcet's jury theorem (1785): majority vote among independent voters each with probability p > 1/2 of being right improves with more voters; if p < 1/2, more voters worsen the outcome. Extensions allow heterogeneous p_i; some work shows the thesis does not hold almost surely without evidence of competence. Our process uses a 5-person adversarial committee that deliberates together (not independent ballot); output is resolution plus decision-space map. CJT could formalize why multi-perspective helps, but our design violates CJT assumptions (dependence, non-binary, no literal p). Options: (a) change process to approximate CJT conditions, (b) use CJT as analogy and document deviations, (c) reject CJT as wrong model.
  success_criteria:
    - "Clear recommendation: change process / document only / reject CJT / or hybrid"
    - "Trade-offs named: fidelity to CJT vs. deliberative quality vs. simplicity"
    - "Evidence or formalization requirements stated if we pursue (a) or (b)"
  exit_conditions:
    - "Committee delivers resolution (PASSED / DEFERRED / NO_CONSENSUS) with votes"
    - "Decision space map and implementation implications surfaced"
  deliverable_format: "Resolution Artifact + Decision Space Map"
