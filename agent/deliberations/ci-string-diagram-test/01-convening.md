# Convening

**Date:** 2026-02-22  
**Selection strategy:** Standard roster from agent/roster.md  
**Rationale:** Full five-character roster provides coverage on incentives (Maya), values (Frankie), past patterns (Joe), evidence (Vic), and second-order effects (Tammy). Sufficient for a scoped infra decision.  
**Composition notes:** Maya×Vic will pressure "who benefits / what's the evidence"; Joe will ask whether we've over-invested in tooling before; Tammy will trace impact on contributor behavior and future test growth.  
**Outcome:** Committee convened. See 01-roster.md.
