# Convening: Contributor Experience in research-programs

**Date**: 2026-02-23

**Selection strategy**: Standard roster from `agent/roster.md`

**Rationale**: This is a usability and information-architecture question with competing values (accessibility vs. depth, newcomer experience vs. maintainer burden, simplicity vs. completeness). The full roster provides coverage across:
- Maya: Who benefits from the current opacity? What if "contributor-friendly" means "dumbed down"?
- Frankie: The project's mission includes making the methodology accessible. Are we living up to that?
- Joe: Past attempts at documentation restructuring. What worked, what didn't?
- Vic: What evidence do we have about actual contributor behavior? Are we guessing?
- Tammy: Second-order effects of restructuring. What feedback loops does the current structure create?

**Composition notes**: Key productive tensions: Maya vs. Frankie (cynicism about contributors vs. idealism about accessibility); Vic vs. all (demanding evidence for claims about contributor confusion); Tammy complicating any simple fix with system effects.

**Remediation parameters**: Default (threshold 13, max rounds 2).

**Outcome**: Committee convened. See 01-roster.md.
