## Independent Review (with-register run)

Verdict: **High**. Same strengths as baseline; **trade-off explicitness** raised to 3 because the resolution and synthesis explicitly state how past calibration was used (weighting well-calibrated characters, hedging maintenance risk with review trigger). Sum 13 meets threshold.
