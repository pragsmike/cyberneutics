resolution:
  date: "2026-02-24"
  topic: "Should we add a short glossary of key terms (e.g. 'fan', 'funnel', 'meta-d'') to the README or a dedicated doc?"
  outcome: PASSED
  decision: "Aye. Add a minimal glossary (5–10 terms) in README or a dedicated doc linked from README; definitions drawn from palgebra/reference and key artifacts; review when we add new terms. Synthesis weighted past calibration: well-calibrated characters' conditions (pilot, barrier) adopted; maintenance-risk hedge (review trigger) retained."
  summary: |
    The committee voted 5–0 Aye. Deliberation used the metacog register: we weighted Frankie, Tammy, and Vic's arguments (well-calibrated in past runs) and retained Joe and Maya's review trigger as the hedge for maintenance risk. Same outcome as baseline (minimal glossary, source of truth) with explicit calibration weighting in the resolution.
  implementation_plan:
    - action: "Draft 5–10 terms with one-line definitions and links. Place in README or dedicated doc; link from README."
    - action: "Review when new terms are added (calibration-informed hedge from maintenance-risk concerns)."
