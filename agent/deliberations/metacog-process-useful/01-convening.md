# Convening

**Date:** 2026-02-22

**Selection strategy:** Standard roster from `agent/roster.md`.

**Rationale:** Full five-member roster. The question is methodological and value-laden (user benefit vs overhead, optional vs default); we need political awareness (Maya), values (Frankie), institutional memory (Joe), evidence (Vic), and systems effects (Tammy).

**Composition notes:** Maya–Vic tension on whether metacog is evidence-based or theater; Joe–Frankie on caution vs commitment to rigor; Tammy surfaces second-order effects of adding tracking to the pipeline.

**Outcome:** Committee convened. See 01-roster.md.
