## Independent Review (post-remediation)

### Charter

The committee was asked to decide whether to keep and recommend the metacognition process (confidence at resolution, metacog register, optional "with register" runs, cumulative-confidence comparison test) as a supported part of the methodology — considering user benefit, overhead, optional vs default, and conditions for removal or simplification.

**Context:** This is the second review, after the committee responded to 04-evaluation-1.md in 05-remediation-1.md and added Round 3 to the deliberation.

---

### Rubric Scores

**1. Reasoning Completeness: 3**

The remediation round fills the gaps identified in the first review. **Vic (Round 3):** "We're using review rubric sum and 'calibration mentioned in the resolution or transcript' as *proxies* for 'the user benefits.' We have not validated that. We don't have a direct measure of whether the end user makes better decisions when they get a with-register run. So for the sunset, 'no consistent benefit' means: these proxies don't improve … If we ever get user feedback or a better outcome measure, we can tighten the claim." The link from comparison-test outcomes to user benefit is now explicit: we use proxies; they are unvalidated; sunset uses them; we can tighten later. **Frankie (Round 3):** "We don't have data on how many users open the register … The register does two things: it's an *input* to the with-register committee run … and it's there for maintainers … So 'who opens the register?' — the with-register run 'opens' it programmatically; beyond that we don't know." Maya's question is answered with a clear scope. **Tammy (Round 3):** The sunset trigger is one sentence: "Deprecate with-register if fewer than 3 of the first 5 comparison runs show with-register ≥ baseline AND calibration mentioned in the resolution or transcript." Every step from premise (we need evidence, we need an exit) to conclusion (tiered recommendation, explicit assumptions, one-sentence trigger) is now on the page. No remaining logical gaps for the purposes of this deliberation.

**2. Adversarial Rigor: 3**

Rounds 1–2 contained genuine conflict (Maya vs recommend-register, Vic's evidence bar, Frankie holding the line on principle). **Round 3** adds a third round in which the committee responds to external evaluation: the Chair frames the evaluator's three recommendations as a motion to recommit; Vic, Frankie, and Tammy each move to accept and implement one; Maya and Joe support or second. The deliberation now includes the "third round" the first review asked for — not internal cross-examination of each other in Round 3, but direct engagement with the outcome measure (proxy assumption), the register-usage challenge (explicit answer), and the sunset trigger (one sentence). The committee did not deflect the evaluation; they incorporated it. Taken as a whole, the transcript shows stress-testing of the position (Rounds 1–2) followed by correction in light of critique (Round 3). No hand-waving survives; the previously unchallenged assumptions are now stated and bounded.

**3. Assumption Surfacing: 3**

**Round 3 and the resolution** now state the key assumptions explicitly. (1) **Proxy assumption:** "We assume review sum and calibration-mentioned are proxies for user benefit; this assumption is not yet validated; the sunset treats no improvement in these proxies as grounds to deprecate with-register." (2) **Register usage:** "Register usage by end users is unknown; we assume the primary consumers are the with-register committee run and maintainers; the sunset review will consider evidence of broader use." (3) The **sunset trigger** is a single, falsifiable sentence. The Decision Space Map (Rounds 1–2) already named three optimizations; the remediation adds the assumptions that were previously implicit. They are now identified, stated in the resolution, and reflected in the implementation plan.

**4. Evidence Standards: 3**

Vic's standard (don't recommend with-register until we have evidence) is applied throughout. **Round 3** tightens the application: the committee explicitly says it has *not* validated the proxy for user benefit and does *not* have data on register usage; it scopes who consumes the register (with-register run, maintainers) and defers the rest to the sunset review. No unfalsifiable claims are accepted: "we don't know" and "we assume" are used where evidence is absent. The sunset trigger is falsifiable (after 5 runs we can check). Evidentiary standards are consistently enforced; the previous gaps (rhetorical questions left unanswered, proxy unstated) are closed.

**5. Trade-off Explicitness: 3**

Unchanged from first review. Trade-offs remain specific: overhead (two runs, two reviews, compare script); marginal cost zero for confidence vs bigger nudge for register; time and count triggers (12 months or 5 runs; deprecate if fewer than 3 of 5 show benefit). The resolution now includes the one-sentence sunset trigger in the implementation plan, making the exit condition unambiguous. Decision criteria and consequences are clear.

### Aggregate Score

**Sum: 15 / 15** (average 3.0)

### Structural Assessment

**Charter fitness:** The deliberation, including remediation, fully addresses the charter. The resolution and implementation plan now include the tiered recommendation, the explicit proxy and register-usage assumptions, and the one-sentence sunset trigger. Conditions for removal or simplification are stated and falsifiable.

**Character calibration:** In Round 3, Vic states the proxy assumption (evidence-focused); Frankie takes the register question and scopes it (values: we're not overclaiming); Tammy proposes the one-sentence sunset (systems: unambiguous trigger). Maya and Joe support. Characters remain consistent with their propensities; the remediation round is in character.

**Engagement depth:** The debate evolved across three rounds. Round 1–2 established tiered recommendation and sunset; Round 3 responded to evaluation by making implicit assumptions explicit and tightening the sunset. The terms of the argument were extended, not repeated.

**Synthesis quality:** The resolution and 03-resolution.md now honestly represent both the substantive outcome (keep, tier, sunset) and the assumptions (proxies unvalidated, register usage unknown and scoped). The implementation plan is actionable and includes the exact trigger.

### Biggest Gaps

None. The three gaps identified in the first review have been addressed in Round 3 and in the updated resolution.

---

### What Would Most Improve This Deliberation

No further recommendations. The deliberation is suitable for use as decision input. If the methodology is updated per the resolution, the artifacts should state the proxy assumption, register-usage assumption, and one-sentence sunset trigger as specified in the implementation plan.

---

### Verdict

**Trustworthiness as decision input: High**

The deliberation, including the remediation round, is rigorous and trustworthy. Reasoning chains are complete; the proxy and register-usage assumptions are explicit; the sunset trigger is one sentence and falsifiable. The committee responded to independent evaluation by incorporating all three recommendations. **Sum 15 meets and exceeds the default threshold (13).** Safe to use as decision input; implement the resolution and extract lessons for future methodology updates.
