# Response to evaluation (motion to recommit)

The independent review scored the deliberation 11/15 (below threshold 13) and identified three main gaps. The committee treats this as a motion to recommit: we will add a round of debate that addresses each recommendation, then update the resolution to reflect what we add.

## Point-by-point response

**1. Make the outcome proxy explicit.**  
**Accept.** The evaluator is right: we treated "with-register ≥ baseline and calibration mentioned" as evidence of benefit without stating that review sum and calibration-mentioned are *proxies* for user benefit, not validated measures of it. In Round 3 we will add an exchange where Vic (or Maya) states this explicitly: we are using these proxies; we have not validated them; for the sunset we treat "no consistent benefit" as these proxies not improving; if we get user feedback later, we can tighten the claim. We will add this as an explicit assumption to the resolution or implementation plan.

**2. Address Maya's "who opens the register?"**  
**Accept.** We will have a character (Frankie or Joe) respond explicitly: we do not have data on how many users open the register. We will add to our position either (a) "We don't know; we'll include register usage in the sunset review — if there's no evidence of use, we simplify," or (b) "The register is consumed by the with-register committee run and by maintainers; we are not claiming every end user reads it." The resolution will state which assumption we are making (e.g. "Register usage is unknown; sunset review will consider it").

**3. Tighten the sunset clause.**  
**Accept.** We will state the trigger in one unambiguous sentence: "Deprecate with-register if fewer than 3 of the first 5 comparison runs show with-register ≥ baseline AND calibration mentioned in the resolution or transcript." This will be added to the implementation plan and, if needed, to the resolution summary so the exit condition is falsifiable.

## New round to be added

**Round 3** will contain:
- Chair frames the evaluation as a motion to recommit and reads the three recommendations.
- Vic (or Maya) states the proxy assumption explicitly and proposes wording for the artifacts.
- Frankie or Joe responds to "who opens the register?" with the chosen framing (unknown + sunset, or register as input to with-register/maintainers).
- Tammy (or Joe) proposes the tightened sunset trigger: "Deprecate if fewer than 3 of the first 5 comparison runs show with-register ≥ baseline AND calibration mentioned."
- Committee agrees to add these to the resolution and implementation plan.

After Round 3 we will update 03-resolution.md to include: (1) the explicit proxy assumption, (2) the register-usage assumption or scope, (3) the one-sentence sunset trigger.
