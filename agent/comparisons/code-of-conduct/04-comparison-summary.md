# Comparison Summary: Deliberative vs. CJT-Style (Code of Conduct)

**Question:** Should we add a Code of Conduct (CoC) to the repository?

**Pipelines:** Same roster, same charter. Deliberative = committee with debate. CJT-style = five independent votes (no cross-reading), then majority.

## Outcomes

| Pipeline       | Aggregate / Resolution | Votes (Aye–Nay–Abstain) |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **CJT-style**  | Majority Aye (3–2). Add a Code of Conduct. | 3–2–0 (Frankie, Vic, Tammy Aye; Maya, Joe Nay) |
| **Deliberative** | Do not add a CoC. No enforcement process; revisit if we establish one or have evidence we need one. Optionally signal expectations in README. | 0–5–0 (unanimous Nay) |

**Outcome divergence:** **CJT-style said Aye. Deliberative said Nay.** The two pipelines produced **opposite recommendations**.

## What changed in deliberation

1. **Three votes flipped (Aye → Nay):** Frankie, Vic, and Tammy all voted Aye in the independent run. In Round 1, Maya and Joe pressed: we have no moderation team; who enforces a CoC? Vic conceded that adding a document we might apply selectively creates weaponization risk and moved to Nay. Tammy conceded that we're not set up to interpret the CoC fairly and moved to Nay. Frankie moved to Nay after concluding that an "aspirational only" CoC either creates the same risk or is too weak to matter.

2. **Stress-test that only happened in deliberation:** The enforcement question — "who decides, who enforces?" — was not answered in the CJT-style rationales. In isolation, Vic and Tammy weighed "low cost / sets expectations" and voted Aye. In debate, they had to face the counterargument that we have no process, and they changed their view.

3. **Principle vs. risk:** Frankie's principle ("name the community we want") was stress-tested against Maya and Joe's "don't create a weapon you can't wield fairly." In deliberation, the risk argument won; in isolation, the principle argument had a majority.

## Interpretation

- **Deliberation changed the outcome.** Independent aggregation: Aye 3–2. After debate: Nay 5–0. This is a clear example where the two pipelines **disagree**.
- **Why:** The key objection (enforcement, weaponization) was present in the CJT-style run (Maya, Joe) but the Aye voters never had to respond to it. In deliberation, they did — and three of them changed their votes.
- **Implication for the comparison:** On value-laden, enforcement-sensitive questions, the deliberative pipeline can produce a different (and in this case more cautious) result than independent vote then majority. The CoC comparison is evidence that **process matters**: same question, same roster, different process, different verdict.

**Conclusion:** This run demonstrates that deliberative vs. CJT-style can yield **different results**. The Code of Conduct question was well-suited to surface that divergence.
