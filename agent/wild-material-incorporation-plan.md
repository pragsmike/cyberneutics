# Wild Material Incorporation Plan

## Executive Summary

The cyberneutics essay collection (Essays 01-10 plus supplementary essays) has developed a rigorous methodology for working with LLMs as collaborative sense-making partners. Three bodies of wild material—**Pask's Conversation Theory**, **O'Reilly's Residuality Theory**, and the **Neo-Cybernetics initiative**—enrich this foundation by:

1. **Conversation Theory** provides the micro-mechanics of how deliberation actually works. Pask's teachback mechanism operationalizes what the committee does; entailment meshes formalize how knowledge accumulates. The teachback-as-residuality connection unifies Pask with O'Reilly at different scales.

2. **Residuality Theory** offers architectural walks as the formalization of the Probe operation's repeated runs. The residues/eigenforms distinction sharpens the treatment in Essay 10, adding the "criticality over correctness" optimization target. The residuality framing complements palgebra without replacing it.

3. **Neo-Cybernetics** is primarily a meta/community matter—positioning cyberneutics within a broader revival of cybernetic thinking for 21st-century technology. At the content level, it offers minimal new methodology but validates the theoretical directions cyberneutics has taken.

This plan identifies specific augmentation opportunities per essay, proposes three new documents to formalize the wild material into essays, and recommends a phased integration approach prioritizing high-value, low-effort additions.

## Part 1: Essay-by-Essay Augmentation Opportunities

### Essay 01: Why Narrative Engines Change Everything

**Wild material connects:** Von Foerster's ethical imperative; Pask's view of interaction as fundamental to intelligence.

**Specific insertion points:**

- **Section: "What a Narrative Engine Is"** — Add a paragraph contrasting first-order (oracle) vs. second-order (coupled system) views. Currently the essay states this contrast implicitly. Wild material makes von Foerster's explicit formulation available: observation changes state, and the observer is part of the system.
- **Section: "The Observer's Responsibility"** — Anchor von Foerster's ethical imperative ("Act always so as to increase the number of choices") as a design principle for LLM interaction. Currently implicit in the essay; making it explicit grounded in historical cybernetics strengthens the claim.
- **New subsection: "The Paskian Perspective: Intelligence is Interactive"** — Pask's claim that intelligence resides in *interaction loops* (not "inside a head or box") directly supports Essay 01's framing of narrative engines as fundamentally coupled systems. A short sidebar (2-3 paragraphs) defining Pask's interactive view of intelligence, with a forward pointer to Conversation Theory in Essay 03.

**What the augmentation adds:** Historical grounding and philosophical authority. These are not new ideas in cyberneutics; they are recoveries of mid-century cybernetics thinkers. Making that lineage explicit strengthens the "this is not just philosophy" argument.

**Type of change:** Footnotes/asides for von Foerster; new subsection for Pask (low effort, high clarity gain).

---

### Essay 03: Sense-Making 101

**Wild material connects:** Pask's conversation theory as operationalized sense-making; gap-first dialogue patterns from conversation-theory.md.

**Specific insertion points:**

- **Section: "The Critical Insight: Bridges Change Situations"** — This section describes gaps, bridges, and situation transformation. The Pask integration shows *how* bridges work micro-mechanically.
  - Add a subsection: **"Teachback as Bridge-Testing"** — Dervin describes bridge-construction abstractly. Pask provides mechanism: after constructing a bridge (hypothesis, reframing, action), **teachback** it—explain it back in your own terms, apply it to a new context, role-reverse with a partner. The bridge counts as successful when you can sustain mutual understanding despite perturbation. This is Dervin's bridge-building made operational.
  - Reference the "Conversation theory in cyberneutics" section from wild/cybernetics/conversation-theory.md, which integrates Pask + Dervin + Deleuze. Summary: the learner walks a rhizomatic space (Deleuze), encounters gaps (Dervin), and uses conversation to construct bridges that stabilize (Pask).

- **Section: "Why This Matters for AI Interaction"** — Add a design pattern subsection: **"Gap-First Dialogue with Teachback Loops."**
  - Ask the user explicitly: what confuses you? What's your gap? (Dervin's gap-first method)
  - After proposing a bridge (information, reframing, action), ask them to restate it in their own terms (Pask's teachback).
  - Log gaps and bridges as first-class objects in the interaction.
  - This transforms Sense-Making from a theoretical framework into a conversation design pattern.

**What the augmentation adds:** A concrete operational procedure for sense-making. Currently Essay 03 is largely descriptive; adding Pask + teachback makes it prescriptive without losing the theoretical depth.

**Type of change:** New subsections within existing sections (moderate effort, high utility).

---

### Essay 04: Cybernetics and the Observer Problem

**Wild material connects:** Von Foerster's second-order cybernetics; eigenforms formalized; Pask's conversational closure as an observable phenomenon.

**Specific insertion points:**

- **Section: "Eigenforms: How Stability Emerges from Noise"** — This section describes eigenforms (x = F(x)) and uses them to explain dialogue stabilization. The wild material allows several augmentations:
  - **Subsection: "Von Foerster's Mathematical Formalism"** — Cite the von Foerster wild material for the formal definition and historical context (Biological Computer Laboratory, second-order cybernetics framing). This makes the concept less abstract.
  - **Paragraph on conversational eigenforms** — Add a reference to Pask: when a conversation reaches a state where both participants can correctly describe each other's understanding and that understanding persists, you've found a conversational eigenform. The entailment mesh is a residual structure that survives perturbation (Pask's teachback shocks). Bridges this to the next essay.
  - Strengthen the committee eigenform argument: "We use noise (character conflict) to prevent shallow eigenforms" now has historical backing in von Foerster's work on second-order cybernetics and destabilization.

- **Section: "The Observer's Responsibility"** — Extend the footnote on explainability (first-order thinking) to cite von Foerster's radical constructivism: "It is like I tell it, not tell it like it is." The demand for explainability assumes an objective world to explain; second-order cybernetics reframes this as: we are explaining how we construct our understanding, not how the system "really" works.

**What the augmentation adds:** Mathematical formalism and historical authority for eigenforms; a bridge between eigenforms and conversational phenomena (Pask); sharpening the constructivist stance underlying the methodology.

**Type of change:** Subsections within "Eigenforms" section; extended footnote on explainability (low-to-moderate effort, high conceptual gain).

---

### Essay 05: The Synthesis

**Wild material connects:** Pask-Deleuze-Dervin integration from conversation-theory.md.

**Specific insertion points:**

- **Overview section** — This essay claims that Deleuze, Dervin, and Boland converge on a shared insight about how narrative engineering works. The Pask material shows this convergence is not unique to cyberneutics; **Pask arrived at nearly identical positions independently in the 1960s-70s.**
  - Add a paragraph: "Conversation Theory and the Synthesis" — Pask, roughly contemporary with Deleuze and decades before Dervin's formal SMM, treated learning as movement through a rhizomatic entailment mesh where conversations bridge gaps and stabilize understanding. This independent convergence strengthens the synthesis claim: it is not idiosyncratic to one author but reflects deep structural truths about how meaning-making works.

- **The Synthesis diagram/framing** — Currently the synthesis emphasizes Deleuze (geometry of the space), Dervin (phenomenology of gaps), and Boland (institutional practice). Add Pask: **micro-mechanics of conversation**. The four together give a complete picture:
  - Space: rhizomatic, non-hierarchical (Deleuze)
  - Phenomenology: situated gap-bridging (Dervin)
  - Mechanics: teachback, entailment mesh stabilization (Pask)
  - Institutional practice: narrative engineering as epistemic discipline (Boland)

**What the augmentation adds:** Historical validation; closure on the convergence argument by showing Pask arrived at compatible conclusions independently.

**Type of change:** New paragraph + diagram enhancement (low effort, significant conceptual gain).

---

### Essay 06: Deleuze, Difference and Repetition

**Wild material connects:** O'Reilly's architectural walks as Deleuzian repetition made operational; Deleuze cited explicitly in O'Reilly's work.

**Specific insertion points:**

- **Section: "Repetition Produces Difference"** — This section describes Deleuze's insight that repetition is never the same (the walker and the path change). Add a new subsection: **"Architectural Walks: Operationalizing Repetition"**
  - Reference O'Reilly's concept of architectural walks from wild/residuality-theory/README.md: you walk a system multiple times; each repetition differs; differences accumulate into understanding.
  - O'Reilly explicitly grounds this in Deleuze's process philosophy. This is not reinterpretation; it is direct application.
  - Connect to cyberneutics: the Probe operation (running fan→funnel N times) is an architectural walk through a decision space. Each run follows different lines of flight; what recurs is the eigenform; what diverges reveals the decision landscape's topology.
  - **Strengthens the "this isn't just philosophy" argument:** Deleuze's abstract insight (repetition produces difference) becomes a concrete practice (repeated traversal builds understanding), which becomes a formal operation (Probe).

- **Section: "Rhizomes and the Smooth Space"** — Add a reference to Pask's entailment meshes as a concrete instantiation of rhizomatic structure. The entailment mesh is already rhizomatic: concepts are cyclically mutually entailing (not hierarchical). This shows Deleuze's conceptual vocabulary maps directly to learning theory.

**What the augmentation adds:** Direct operationalization of abstract Deleuzian concepts; validation through a practice-grounded theorist (O'Reilly) who independently arrived at compatible conclusions; strengthens the argument that abstraction and practice are unified in cyberneutics.

**Type of change:** New subsection in repetition section; extended reference in rhizomes section (moderate effort, high impact).

---

### Essay 07: Boland's Narrative Engineering

**Wild material connects:** Von Foerster's Biological Computer Laboratory as historical precedent for building methodology communities; community-building playbook from wild/cybernetics/community-building.md.

**Specific insertion points:**

- **Section: "Building and Maintaining Epistemic Community"** (if it exists) or **new subsection in the institutional practice section:**
  - Add: **"Historical Precedent: The Biological Computer Laboratory"** — Von Foerster's BCL (1958-1975) at Illinois was a hub bringing together engineers, philosophers, artists, and social scientists in shared systems-oriented conversation. This is exactly the community-building challenge Boland describes: how do you create a space where multiple disciplinary perspectives contribute to rigorous methodology?
  - Use BCL as a historical model: what made it work? (interdisciplinary gathering, shared conceptual vocabulary, playful rigor, experimental spaces). What can we learn for building cyberneutics community?
  - Reference the community-building playbook from wild/cybernetics/community-building.md for contemporary patterns.

**What the augmentation adds:** Historical grounding for the community-building argument; a tested model (BCL) that validates the approach; reduction of isolation ("this has been done before").

**Type of change:** New subsection with historical case study (low-to-moderate effort, moderate-to-high value for community uptake).

---

### Essay 08: From Methodology to Formalism

**Wild material connects:** Residuality Theory as a complementary framing to palgebra; residues/eigenforms relationship; architectural walks as formal operations.

**Specific insertion points:**

- **Section: "Palgebra in Brief" or introduction to palgebra** — Add a subsection: **"Residuality as Complementary Framing"**
  - Palgebra asks: what does each operation *add* to the artifact (enrichment) or produce from it (transformation)?
  - Residuality asks: what *survives* across all operations? What is the fixed architectural substrate?
  - These are not competing; they illuminate different aspects of the same pipeline. A deliberation record is both:
    - A palgebra artifact chain (00-charter → 01-convening → ... → 04-evaluation) with typed stages and quality propagation
    - A residue of the committee process (what arguments, tensions, and resolutions survive the conversational gauntlet?)
  - Single walk/run produces a residue; repeated runs hunt for eigenforms. This maps to the remediation loop (local eigenforms) vs. Probe (global eigenforms).
  - Reference wild/residuality-theory/README.md for the formal treatment.

- **Section on validation/testing of formalism** — Add: **"Architectural Walks as Formal Operations"**
  - The Probe skill runs the same operation (fan→funnel) N times. In residuality terms, this is N architectural walks through the decision space.
  - The variance report shows residues (what each walk found) and landscape map shows eigenforms (what every walk found).
  - This is not a hack or empirical approximation; it is a formal property of the decision monad (from palgebra/duality-and-composition.md).
  - Residuality Theory provides the philosophical grounding for why iteration matters; palgebra provides the type-theoretic machinery.

**What the augmentation adds:** A second theoretical lens on the same pipeline, enriching understanding without rewriting; validation that multiple formalisms (algebraic and residual) converge on the same operations.

**Type of change:** New subsections integrating residuality into existing palgebra discussion (moderate effort, high conceptual gain).

---

### Essay 09: Narrative Immune Systems

**Wild material connects:** Teachback-as-residuality; what survives perturbation is knowledge; immune system as generator-discriminator with bounded feedback.

**Specific insertion points:**

- **Section: "The immune analogy"** — Extend the generator-discriminator analogy to include the teachback loop:
  - Current treatment: generator produces text → discriminator scores → failures rejected/fed back.
  - Add Pask dimension: **"What counts as robust is what survives re-articulation"** — After evaluation, ask a fresh instance to teach back the reasoning (re-articulate it, apply it to edge cases, defend it against challenge). Gaps in teachback reveal gaps in reasoning. This is Pask's operationalized immune function: mutation (teachback reinterpretation) followed by selection (does the re-stated understanding still hold?).
  - Reference conversation-theory.md section on "teachback and residuality": both Pask and immune systems identify knowledge as what persists under perturbation.

- **Section: "Memory cells"** (predicted missing parts) — Add concrete suggestion:
  - In Pask's terms: evaluate a large corpus of past deliberations to identify entailment patterns that consistently appear in high-quality resolutions. Build rubrics that recognize these patterns (learned antibodies). This is cross-scenario learning made explicit.
  - Reference wild/cybernetics/conversation-theory.md and the integration of Pask-Dervin: stable entailment structures emerge from repeated bridging of similar gaps. Memory cells would encode this accumulated bridge-building.

**What the augmentation adds:** A mechanistic understanding of immune function grounded in conversation theory; operationalization of the "memory cells" prediction; stronger connection between palgebra evaluation and knowledge accumulation.

**Type of change:** Extended analogies in existing section; development of "predicted missing parts" (moderate effort, moderately impacts theoretical closure).

---

### Essay 10: Decisions Under Uncertainty

**Wild material connects:** Architectural walks; residues vs. eigenforms; criticality over correctness; O'Reilly's philosophy of architecture as orthogonal optimization target.

**Specific insertion points:**

- **Section: "Repetition as instrument" / "Residues and eigenforms"** — This section already references O'Reilly and residuality. Expand it:
  - Current treatment: residues = single walk finds; eigenforms = every walk finds.
  - **Add subsection: "What to Optimize For"**—
    - Traditional architecture optimizes for *correctness* (does it satisfy the spec?) or *expected value* (does it maximize utility across likely futures?).
    - O'Reilly's residuality framework suggests an alternative: **criticality** (does it survive unknown stressors?) — not maximizing performance on known cases but satisficing on unknown ones.
    - Wicked problems are exactly those where the future stressor set is unknowable. Expected utility fails. Optimizing for criticality (building residues that handle many stressors) is more appropriate.
    - Cite O'Reilly: "Criticality over Correctness" (from wild/residuality-theory/README.md).
    - In decision monad terms: the funnel's evaluation rubrics should not ask "is this the best decision?" but "is this decision robust to unanticipated futures?" This shifts the optimization surface.

- **Section: "Architectural walks"** — Already present. Strengthen the connection:
  - Add that the landscape map produced by `/probe` is exactly O'Reilly's stressor landscape: each scenario is a stressor; repeated runs discover which residues (decision components) survive many stressors; eigenforms are architecturally robust decisions.
  - The remediation cap question (why stop at 2 rounds?) can be re-framed in residuality terms: are we stopping at local fixed points (single-pass eigenforms) without mapping global robustness? This is an open question worth probing empirically.

**What the augmentation adds:** A second optimization target (criticality) orthogonal to expected utility; richer interpretation of the landscape map and remediation cap; validates the Probe operation as a residuality-theoretic procedure.

**Type of change:** New subsection on optimization; extended existing section on residues/eigenforms (moderate effort, directly strengthens practical guidance).

---

### Other Essays: Targeted References

**Essay 02: From Practice to Theory**
- Add brief reference to Pask's maxim: cybernetics is "the art of creating defensible metaphors." This frames theory-building as a cybernetic activity, not a separate task.
- Type: footnote (trivial effort).

**Narrative Computing History, Societies of Thought, Stories All the Way Down, etc.**
- These can reference wild material where relevant (e.g., citing Pask's work on interactive systems in narrative-computing-history; O'Reilly's concept of residues in societies-of-thought).
- Type: selective citations in existing material (low effort).

---

## Part 2: New Documents Proposed

### Proposed Essay 11: "Conversation Theory and Cyberneutics"

**Scope:** A 6,000-8,000 word essay formalizing Pask's Conversation Theory and its role in cyberneutics.

**Thesis:** Pask's Conversation Theory provides the missing micro-mechanics for how committees (and more generally, deliberation) work. The theory shows that knowledge is a residual—what persists after being tested, reformulated, and applied. Teachback is the operational method for testing. This unifies Pask, O'Reilly, and cyberneutics under a single philosophical commitment: **meaning is what survives perturbation.**

**Key arguments:**

1. **Conversation as the primitive:** Learning/knowledge-making is not transfer of information but recursive conversation where participants achieve mutual understanding through repeated teaching, challenge, and reformulation.

2. **Teachback as operational test:** A claim counts as understood when you can teach it back (re-articulate, apply to new contexts, defend against challenge) and maintain mutual agreement despite perturbation.

3. **Entailment meshes as knowledge structure:** Concepts are not isolated facts but cyclically mutually-entailing networks. The mesh encodes prerequisite, analogical, and subordinate relationships. A learner's mesh evolves as they bridge gaps; the evolved mesh shapes future learning.

4. **Pask meets Deleuze, Dervin:** Entailment meshes are rhizomatic; learning walks them (Deleuze); gaps trigger conversation (Dervin); teachback stabilizes bridges (Pask). The three are one.

5. **Teachback-as-residuality:** What survives teachback, challenge, application, and role-reversal is the residual structure of understanding. Pask's micro-scale learning theory and O'Reilly's macro-scale architecture theory describe the same pattern at different scales.

6. **Application to cyberneutics:** The committee process is a formalized conversation (characters playing roles; artifacts as utterances; rubrics as challenge/test). Evaluation rubrics are the "shocks" that test understanding. Remediation is re-teaching.

**Placement:** Essay 11 (supplementary) or could replace/absorb a shorter essay if needed.

**Dependencies:** Requires reading wild/cybernetics/conversation-theory.md and wild/cybernetics/gordon-pask.md.

### Proposed Supplementary Essay: "Residuality and the Decision Landscape"

**Scope:** A 4,000-5,000 word essay on residuality and its relationship to decision-making under uncertainty.

**Thesis:** O'Reilly's architectural walks formalize what the Probe operation does—it maps the decision landscape by walking it repeatedly, discovering residues (what any single walk finds) and eigenforms (what every walk finds). The landscape map is not a probability distribution but a topological map of basins of attraction and ridge lines. Decisions are robust not because they maximize expected utility but because they survive many stressors (eigenforms).

**Key arguments:**

1. **Architectural walks as exploration:** You walk a system/problem space multiple times. Each walk differs (walker and path are different). Differences accumulate into understanding that no single pass provides.

2. **Stressors as adversaries:** Each scenario in fan phase is a stressor (something trying to break the decision). Resilience is what survives many stressors (residue). Robustness is what survives *all* our imagined stressors (eigenform).

3. **Criticality over correctness:** The optimization target for wicked problems shifts from maximizing performance on known cases to surviving unknown ones. A "critical" architecture is one where residues accumulate rapidly and solidly.

4. **The landscape map:** Repeated Probe runs produce a variance report: which decisions recur? Where do runs diverge? The pattern of divergence reveals the decision space's topology—basins of attraction (eigenforms), ridges (sensitive points), voids (unexplored regions).

5. **Remediation and local eigenforms:** The 2-round remediation cap hunts for local eigenforms within a single run. The Probe's N runs hunt for global eigenforms. The two together distinguish shallow fixed points from robust ones.

6. **From theory to practice:** How to use the landscape map—where to invest further exploration, where to commit, where to stay vigilant for surprise.

**Placement:** Supplementary essay (follows Essay 10) or could be published as an artifact-level guide if brevity is preferred.

**Dependencies:** Requires wild/residuality-theory/README.md and palgebra/duality-and-composition.md.

---

### Proposed Artifact: "Teachback Protocol for Committee Evaluation"

**Scope:** A 2,000-2,500 word practical technique guide.

**Purpose:** Operationalize Pask's teachback as a committee evaluation method, complementing the existing rubric-based evaluation.

**Structure:**

1. **What and why:** Teachback is a test of understanding. After a deliberation produces a resolution, ask a fresh LLM instance to "teach back" the reasoning—restate the arguments, defend the resolution against a challenge, apply it to a new scenario. Gaps in teachback reveal gaps in reasoning.

2. **How to run it:**
   - Take the 03-resolution.md from a committee run
   - Prompt a fresh instance: "Here is a decision resolution. Teach me the reasoning back. Restate the key arguments. Defend it against this challenge: [counterargument]. How would you apply this to [variant scenario]?"
   - Score the teachback against rubrics: coherence, fidelity to the original reasoning, adaptability to new contexts.
   - If gaps appear → feed back to remediation (Pask's conversational loop made operational).

3. **When to use it:** After initial evaluation, before committing to a decision. Especially useful for high-stakes decisions where understanding the reasoning is critical.

4. **What it adds:** Rubric-based evaluation tests output quality; teachback tests reasoning solidity. Together they form a two-stage evaluation gauntlet (positive and negative selection, in immune-system terms).

5. **Integration with cross-scenario learning:** Archive teachback results across deliberations. Patterns in what fails to teach back reveal systematic reasoning gaps (e.g., circular reasoning, unjustified assumptions, context-blindness). This is affinity maturation (immune memory).

**Placement:** artifacts/ directory, linked from artifacts/README.md and from Essay 09.

## Part 4: What NOT to Integrate

### Neo-Cybernetics Positioning

**Why staying in wild/ is appropriate:**

Neo-Cybernetics (Daniele Nanni, et al.) is a contemporary initiative applying cybernetics to 21st-century technology and social questions. It has substantial overlap with cyberneutics at the content level (both root in second-order cybernetics, both emphasize observation-changes-state, both are transdisciplinary) but is a distinct project.

**What NOT to do:**
- Do not position cyberneutics as a Neo-Cybernetics case study or sub-project within essays. This is an organizational/community decision, not a methodological one.
- Do not integrate Neo-Cybernetics concepts into the essays as novel contributions. The material is largely validation/affirmation of existing directions, not new methodology.

**What could be done (meta decision):**
- Document the relationship in a meta/ file (e.g., meta/neo-cybernetics-positioning.md) exploring whether cyberneutics should formally position itself within the Neo-Cybernetics ecosystem (federation, collaboration, visibility).
- This is a strategic/governance decision for the repository authors and community, not an essay decision.
- Reference: wild/neo-cybernetics/content-level-relations.md and meta-level-relations.md already document the relationships.

---

### Material That Stays Wild

**Von Foerster's Community-Building Playbook** (wild/cybernetics/community-building.md)
- Fascinating as historical context for how to build methodology communities (BCL model).
- Tangential to the core methodology; properly belongs in wild/ as a resource for community-building, not as content for essays.
- **Exception:** Can be referenced in Essay 07's community subsection (see Phase 4), but the essay should not replicate the playbook.

**Neo-Cybernetics Federation Model and Governance** (wild/neo-cybernetics/)
- Organizational/strategic material, not methodological.
- Should remain in wild/ pending a meta-level decision about cyberneutics's organizational stance.

**Harness Engineering and Software Factories** (wild/harness-engineering/, wild/software-factories/)
- These explore adjacent technical domains (dark factories, AI coding levels, etc.) without yet establishing deep connections to core cyberneutics methodology.
- Should remain in wild/ until integration points are clearer.
- Valuable for future exploration but not ready for essay incorporation.

* `conversation-theory-cyberneutics.md` (Essay 11): Done — `essays/11-conversation-theory-cyberneutics.md`. Formalizes Pask's work and its role in cyberneutics; unifies Pask-Deleuze-Dervin; operationalizes teachback; bridges to residuality.
* `residuality-and-decision-landscape.md` (Supplementary): Done — `essays/supplementary-residuality-and-decision-landscape.md`. O'Reilly's architectural walks as formalization of Probe; residues vs. eigenforms; criticality over correctness.
```

**Section 3: TODO Items**

Add new completed items:

```markdown
* ~~**Integrate wild/cybernetics (Pask, von Foerster) into essays 01-10**~~: Done — Phased incorporation: Phase 1 augmentations (Essays 01, 03, 04, 05, 10); Phase 2 (Essay 11 + Teachback artifact + Pask deepening); Phase 3 (Residuality essay + Essays 08-10 deepening); Phase 4 (Essay 07 + 09 + community). See agent/wild-material-incorporation-plan.md for details.

* ~~**Integrate wild/residuality-theory into palgebra and Essay 10**~~: Done — Phase 3 completed.

* ~~**Document Neo-Cybernetics relationship (meta decision pending)**~~: Documented but not integrated into essays (intentionally). Material remains in wild/neo-cybernetics/ pending organizational decision. See agent/wild-material-incorporation-plan.md Part 4.

## Appendix: File Dependencies and Reading Order

For implementing this plan, the reading order is:

1. **Foundational:** wild/cybernetics/gordon-pask.md, von-Foerster.md (biographical + context)
2. **Theory:** wild/cybernetics/conversation-theory.md (Pask + integration with Deleuze/Dervin)
3. **Residuality:** wild/residuality-theory/README.md (O'Reilly overview + connections)
4. **Neo-Cybernetics (optional for community positioning):** wild/neo-cybernetics/README.md + content-level-relations.md + meta-level-relations.md
5. **Community (Phase 4 only):** wild/cybernetics/community-building.md

**Cross-check against essays:**
- Essays 01-10: read in order (already available)
- Palgebra: read palgebra/duality-and-composition.md (especially decision monad and Probe operation)
- Artifacts: review adversarial-committees.md, scenario-generation.md for practical context

## Summary: Expected Outcomes

**After completing all phases:**

1. **Essays 01-10 enriched** with Von Foerster, Pask, and O'Reilly material, providing historical grounding and operational mechanics for core concepts.

2. **Essay 11 (Conversation Theory and Cyberneutics)** formalizes Pask and shows its role in the larger cyberneutics picture. Key claim: **meaning is what survives perturbation** (Pask, O'Reilly, cyberneutics unified).

3. **Supplementary Essay: Residuality and Decision Landscape** operationalizes O'Reilly's framework for decision-making under uncertainty. Key insight: **criticality (surviving unknown stressors) as optimization target, not correctness or expected utility.**

4. **Artifact: Teachback Protocol** makes Pask's method operational within the evaluation pipeline. Strengthens immune-system framing.

5. **Methodology coherence:** The repository now makes visible the deep agreement between:
   - Pask (1960s-70s): Learning is conversation; understanding survives testing.
   - Deleuze (1968): Becoming is repetition; difference is what repeats.
   - Dervin (1980s-90s): Sense-making is gap-bridging; situation transforms through bridging.
   - von Foerster (1950s-2002): Observation changes state; ethics is increasing choices.
   - O'Reilly (2020s): Architecture survives stressors; criticality is the measure.
   - Cyberneutics (2024-): Narrative engines require adversarial committees, scenario generation, teachback evaluation, and iterative landscape mapping.

This is not five separate theories. It is one theory, arriving via different paths, at different scales, in different eras. Making that unity explicit strengthens every part.
