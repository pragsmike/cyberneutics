# Contributing to Cyberneutics

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Cyberneutics. This methodology evolves through practice, and we welcome contributions that refine the theory or expand the toolkit.

## How to Contribute

### 1. New Artifacts & Techniques
If you have developed a new technique (e.g., a specific committee structure, an evaluation protocol, or a forcing function):
- **Create a new Markdown file** in `artifacts/`.
- **Follow the structure** of existing artifacts:
    - Problem Statement (What does this solve?)
    - The Technique (How do you do it?)
    - Example/Template
    - When to use it
- **Link it** in `artifacts/README.md`.

### 2. Essays & Theory
Theoretical contributions are welcome but undergo stricter review to ensure consistency with the core axioms (Narrative Computing, Cybernetics, Sense-Making).
- **Draft your essay** in `essays/` (you can start with a PR or draft).
- **Ensure you reference** existing foundational texts.
- **Tone**: Rigorous but accessible.

### 3. Examples & Case Studies
We always need more data points.
- **Submit transcripts** in `artifacts/examples/`.
- **Annotate** them with lessons learned.
- **Ensure anonymity** if the content is sensitive (redact names/specifics).

## Style Guide

- **Markdown**: Use standard GitHub Flavored Markdown.
- **Links**: Use relative links (`./file.md` or `../dir/file.md`).
- **Diagrams**: Mermaid.js is preferred for diagrams.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code/artifacts, verify they render correctly.
3. Ensure your contribution is added to the relevant `README.md` (root or subdirectory).
4. Issue that PR!
