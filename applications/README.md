# Applications

Domain analyses that apply the Cyberneutics framework to real-world phenomena.

The [essays](../essays/) build the theoretical foundations. The [palgebra](../palgebra/) provides formal machinery. The [artifacts](../artifacts/) provide practical techniques. This directory shows what happens when you point those tools at a problem domain and see what they reveal.

Each subdirectory is a self-contained investigation. The framework provides the vocabulary (trust boundaries, organ/bath regimes, soft types, immune function, generator-discriminator loops); the application provides the territory.

### [Narrative Immune Systems](./narrative-immune-systems/)

Information warfare, journalism, and the trust commons — analyzed through the immune-system analogy developed in [Essay 09](../essays/09-narrative-immune-systems.md).

How false journalism functions as signal hijack rather than counter-argument. How the trust commons that makes real journalism epistemically possible can be deliberately poisoned. How autoimmune disorder at the social scale — branding legitimate signals as threats — is more damaging than simple signal disruption. What LLMs mean for both sides of the arms race.

## What belongs here

An application should:
- Take concepts from the essays or palgebra and apply them to an observed phenomenon
- Reveal something about the domain that the framework makes visible
- Pressure-test the framework by seeing where the analogies hold, strain, and break

An application does not need to:
- Use formal palgebra notation (though it may)
- Be finished or definitive
- Propose solutions — mapping the problem space is sufficient
