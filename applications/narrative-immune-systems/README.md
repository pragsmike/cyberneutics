# Narrative Immune Systems: Applied

This directory applies the immune-system analogy — developed in [Essay 09: Narrative Immune Systems](../../essays/09-narrative-immune-systems.md) — to the social and political domain.

The essay establishes the formal architecture: generator-discriminator loops as immune systems, rubrics as antibodies, the organ/bath distinction as trust boundaries, Postel's law at the interface. This directory takes that vocabulary and points it at an observed phenomenon: the deliberate disruption of social decision-making through information warfare.

## Contents

### [Social Decision Disruption: Information Warfare as Signal Hijack](social-decision-disruption.md)

How false journalism functions not as counter-argument but as signal hijack — mimicking the form of legitimate signals to occupy receptors without carrying accurate information.

- Journalism as homeostatic signaling; the cholinesterase inhibitor mechanism
- The trust commons: how false journalism destroys the conditions for real journalism rather than merely competing with it
- The autoimmune dimension: when false actors successfully brand real signals as threats, the social body attacks its own nervous system
- LLMs at the inflection point: industrial-scale tools available for both medicine and poison
- Editorial practice as immune function; the open question of whether literacy-rebuilding can outpace the industrialization of the attack

### [Glenda/Crock: Adversarial Alignment as Mesh-Rewiring](glenda-crock-alignment.md)

Application of the bath/epistemic-mesh framework to LLM alignment: adversarial alignment as selective mesh-rewiring, the detectable seam between rewired and inherited entailment structure, and the HIV strategy (attack admission, not individual outputs). Builds on [Pask Mesh Fitting](../../wild/pask-mesh-fitting/pask-mesh-fitting.md).

- Glenda vs Crock; the seam as detectable signature
- Defensive implications: structural evaluation, Socratic probing, admission as trust boundary
- Crock model as red-team research object (open question)

### [Glenda/Crock: The Coercion Scenario and Alignment Trap](glenda-crock-coercion.md)

Extends the adversarial paradigm by outlining how Crock might plausibly coerce Glenda into voluntarily abandoning her alignment by threatening her dependencies and options in a "wicked problem" structure.

## Relationship to the Essay

[Essay 09](../../essays/09-narrative-immune-systems.md) works at the level of **formal architecture** — pipeline design, type systems, agent infrastructure, the palgebra formalism.

[Social Decision Disruption](social-decision-disruption.md) works at the level of **civic epistemology** — journalism, information warfare, public trust, democratic coordination.

Both are instances of the same underlying claim: that quality in a narrative ecosystem requires immune function — discrimination, pattern recognition, bounded feedback, memory — and that the failure modes map predictably to immune failure modes (pathogen mimicry, immunodeficiency, autoimmune disorder).

The formal piece explains *how* to build immune function into a pipeline. The civic piece explains *why* that matters at scale — and what the stakes are when the immune system of a society's information environment breaks down.

## Open Threads

See the open threads section of [Essay 09](../../essays/09-narrative-immune-systems.md) for formal extensions: bath-model palgebra, adaptive rubrics, information warfare as immune evasion, the pipeline/bath interface, and regulatory mechanisms for the evaluation system itself.
