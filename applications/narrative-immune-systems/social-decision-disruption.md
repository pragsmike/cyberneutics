# Social Decision Disruption: Information Warfare as Signal Hijack

---

## The Central Claim

Information warfare, at its most sophisticated, is not primarily a persuasion operation. It is an attack on social decision-making infrastructure — on the feedback loops that enable a community to perceive threats accurately and coordinate effective responses. The goal is not to convince anyone of anything in particular. The goal is paralysis.

The organism cannot mount a defense if it cannot read its own signals.

## Journalism as Homeostatic Signaling

Real journalism functions as a society's nervous system. It senses conditions — corruption, danger, opportunity — and transmits signals that enable collective coordination. Like neurotransmitters at a synapse, legitimate journalism:

- Carries verifiable signals from sources to public awareness
- Maintains signal integrity through editorial process
- Enables appropriate collective response
- Self-corrects through reputation, retraction, and accountability

When the signaling system is reliable, the social body can maintain homeostasis: responding to threats, adjusting to change, pursuing shared goals. The professional practices of journalism — source verification, provenance of evidence, separation of fact from interpretation — are not aesthetic conventions. They are the mechanisms that keep the signal clean.

## The Cholinesterase Inhibitor Attack

Cholinesterase inhibitors — nerve agents, certain pesticides — do not destroy the nervous system directly. They block the enzyme that clears acetylcholine from synapses. The result: the nervous system's own signals accumulate without clearance, firing continuously, overwhelming the organism in its own overstimulation. Spasm, paralysis, death — not from an external assault on the body's structure, but from the hijacking of its own communication system.

False journalism works by the same mechanism. It does not need to overpower real journalism in a contest of truth. It needs only to:

- **Mimic the form** of legitimate signals — news format, anchor desk, institutional authority, "sources say"
- **Occupy the receptors** — the attention and interpretive habits people bring to news
- **Trigger inappropriate responses** — outrage, fear, tribal mobilization at false or distorted stimuli
- **Prevent real signals from clearing** — not by refuting them but by flooding the channel so the truth cannot compete with inflammatory noise

The social body convulses. It exhausts itself responding to signals that do not map to real conditions. It loses coordination. It cannot tell what is real.

And crucially: the attack is **invisible from outside the system's own perspective**. The victim cannot distinguish legitimate signals from hijacked ones, because both arrive through the same channels, trigger the same interpretive processes, produce the same subjective sense of having received information. The confusion is the point.

## Unseen Masters and the Organized Crime Analogy

The comparison to organized crime is precise, not rhetorical. Organized crime mimics legitimate business because it wants to:

- Access legitimate channels and infrastructure
- Exploit the public trust those channels carry
- Extract wealth and power while avoiding accountability
- Corrupt the regulatory systems — law enforcement, auditing, judicial process — that would identify and stop it

False journalism does exactly this. It poses as public interest while serving private agendas. It extracts wealth (attention, political capital, donations), not by delivering value but by consuming it. It deliberately degrades the immune system that would identify it — media literacy, fact-checking norms, editorial accountability — because a functioning immune system is its primary threat.

The unseen masters are not persuading anyone. They are devouring the social body's capacity for collective intelligence — the ability to perceive reality clearly enough to coordinate appropriate responses.

## The Trust Commons

Journalism depends on a commons: the shared social capacity to distinguish signal from noise, legitimate reporting from propaganda. This commons is not automatic. It is built through sustained practice — editorial standards, transparency, accountability, the slow accumulation of institutional credibility.

Like any commons, it can be:

- **Sustained** through good stewardship
- **Degraded** through overuse (sensationalism, click optimization)
- **Deliberately poisoned** by coordinated bad actors

Once poisoned, the commons cannot function. If people cannot reliably distinguish real journalism from false, both become equally useless — interchangeable narrative streams with no epistemic weight. The New York Times and a conspiracy blog become "things people say." This is the tragedy: false journalism does not merely compete with real journalism. It destroys the conditions that make real journalism epistemically possible at all.

## The Autoimmune Dimension

The most sophisticated form of the attack does not merely mimic legitimate signals. It brands legitimate signals as threats.

When false actors successfully establish "mainstream media lies" as a live interpretive frame — when fact-checking is framed as censorship, when editorial process is framed as bias — the social body begins attacking its own nervous system. Legitimate signals are rejected. Hijacked signals are embraced. The feedback loops that maintain social homeostasis collapse, not from external pressure but from internal misdirection.

This is autoimmune disorder at the social scale. It is potentially more damaging than simple signal disruption, because the organism is now actively working against its own capacity for accurate perception.

## LLMs at the Inflection Point

Industrial-scale narrative generation changes the calculus on both sides.

**As medicine**: LLMs could strengthen legitimate journalism — rapidly surfacing patterns across large datasets, generating investigative angles, checking claims against comprehensive records, making deep research accessible to smaller newsrooms.

**As poison**: LLMs could supercharge false journalism — generating endless plausible-sounding fake content, personalizing disinformation at individual scale, overwhelming fact-checkers with volume, making provenance nearly impossible to trace.

We are industrializing both medicine and poison simultaneously. The question is whether institutional adaptation can keep pace with the industrialization of the attack.

---

## Editorial Practice as Immune Function

If LLMs are power tools for narrative construction, editorial judgment becomes the immune system — the capacity to distinguish legitimate signals from hijacked ones. In this environment, good editorial practice means:

- **Provenance tracking**: Maintaining clear chains of evidence even when AI assists research
- **Transparency about AI use**: Flagging which parts of the journalistic process involved synthetic generation
- **Adversarial testing**: Using LLMs to challenge stories as rigorously as to construct them
- **Meta-labeling**: Making explicit when presenting "a useful framing" versus "verified facts"
- **Preserving human judgment**: Keeping editorial decisions — what to publish, how to frame — in human hands

These are not merely professional norms. They are the mechanisms by which signal integrity is maintained at the source.

## The Open Question

The attack surface is the public's inability to distinguish the immune system from the autoimmune attack. If false journalism has successfully branded real journalism as "mainstream media lies," then better journalism alone is insufficient. The feedback loops that would allow accurate signals to register are themselves compromised.

This suggests the necessary response is not just better journalism but **rebuilding collective editorial literacy** — helping people understand:

- That all journalism involves editorial choices, and that evaluating those choices is a learnable skill
- That uncertainty, revision, and correction are signs of epistemic integrity, not weakness
- That the distinction between "this might be false" and "this is deliberately poisonous" is meaningful and consequential
- That narrative construction and fact-gathering are both necessary but different activities

The goal is a population that understands — in practice, not just in theory — that deliberate signal hijacking is a form of violence against collective intelligence. Whether journalism as a profession can develop this capacity fast enough, or whether it requires new institutional forms entirely, remains open.

The present piece applies the same analogy to the civic and political domain.*
