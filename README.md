# Cyberneutics: Narrative engineering for the age of narrative computing

> If the tool is a narrative engine, treating it like a calculator is a category error. You don't get mad at a car for not flying; you learn to drive.

## What is Cyberneutics?

> Sounds like something a Rand Corporation analyst would say to avoid being understood. - Hunter S. Thompson, if he were alive

**Cyberneutics** (literally, steering interpretation) is a methodology for working with AI systems as collaborative sense-making partners rather than oracles that deliver answers. It provides rigorous, traceable techniques for **making decisions under genuine uncertainty** — the kind where you can't enumerate outcomes or assign probabilities, and the act of deciding changes what you're deciding about.

Large Language Models are not databases. They are not logic engines. They are **narrative generators** - storytelling machines operating through what we call "the pachinko of stored literature." This changes everything about how we should work with them.

## Narrative computing and narrative engineering

Each generation of computing hardware forced us to adapt how we think about expressing and solving problems. Each generation also required a new engineering discipline.

*Numeric computing*: We got fast arithmetic machines and developed numerical analysis.  
*Symbolic computing*: We got bitstring crunchers and developed software engineering.  
*Narrative computing*: Now we have storytelling engines — and we need **narrative engineering**.  

**Narrative computing** is what the machine does. An LLM takes a prompt and generates a narrative. This is the primitive operation — the transistor of narrative engineering.

**Narrative engineering** is how we compose those primitives into reliable systems. A single LLM call is locally coherent but unreliable, just as a single transistor amplifies but drifts. You don't fix that by building a better transistor. You design circuits: redundancy (multiple perspectives), feedback (evaluation against rubrics), iteration (generate-evaluate-revise loops), and staged composition (charter → deliberation → resolution → evaluation). The engineering makes the system trustworthy even when individual components aren't.

> "We've never had narrative engines powerful enough to make this methodology necessary before."

Software engineering grew from symbolic computing. Narrative engineering grows from narrative computing.

[From Practice to Theory](./essays/02-from-practice-to-theory.md) tells the story of how these practices grew, and the theory used to guide their development.

The essay [Stories All the Way Down](./essays/stories-all-the-way-down.md) explains how everything is a story, how stories are a way to deal with wicked problems, and how we are constantly editing and re-editing the stories we tell ourselves about the world.

## Why does this matter?

Most AI interaction fails because we treat LLMs like search engines or calculators. We ask questions expecting definitive answers. But LLMs are most powerful when understood as **rapid story generators** that help us navigate complexity through narrative exploration.

The core pipeline: **explore** possible futures (scenario generation), **evaluate** them adversarially (committee deliberation), **repeat** to map the decision landscape, and **trace** every commitment to the arguments that produced it. Quality propagates predictably through the pipeline — you always know where the ceiling is and what to improve. See [Decisions Under Uncertainty](./essays/10-decisions-under-uncertainty.md) for the full argument.

The methodology documented here has produced:
- Rigorous, traceable decision-making under genuine uncertainty
- Better identification of blind spots and load-bearing assumptions
- Richer exploration of decision spaces with formal quality tracking
- Auditable artifacts with full provenance (not just chat transcripts)

These aren't incremental improvements. They represent a fundamentally different approach to human-AI collaboration.

The essays describe *why* narrative engines need narrative engineering. The artifacts provide *how* — concrete techniques like adversarial committees and evaluation rubrics. Palgebra provides *what, precisely* — a formal language for specifying pipelines, their types, their quality propagation, and their composition laws. An adversarial committee is a transformation morphism; a rubric evaluation is an enrichment morphism; a human review gate is a collapse operator. The formalism makes these relationships explicit and composable.

**Agent Skills** — Slash commands available when working with an AI agent on this repo

| Command | What it does | When to use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `/committee [topic]` | Runs an adversarial committee deliberation using the roster in `agent/roster.md` | Complex decisions, competing values, "what are we missing?" problems |
| `/scenarios [situation]` | Divergent scenario generation (fan): explore possible futures before committing | Genuine uncertainty about *what might happen* — the fan half of fan/funnel |
| `/probe [situation]` | Runs fan→funnel N times; produces variance report and decision landscape map | High-stakes decisions where understanding the *decision landscape* matters |
| `/review` | Independent evaluation of a committee transcript against five rubrics | After any `/committee` run, or on a pasted transcript — completes the feedback loop |
| `/string-diagram` | Converts resource equations to Mermaid diagrams | Visualizing pipelines, formalizing workflows, editing equation sets |
| `/handoff` | Generates a session handoff for successor agents | End of work sessions, before breaks, after major milestones |

These skills are the methodology made executable: `/committee` operationalizes the adversarial committee technique, `/scenarios` the fan (explore futures), `/probe` the repeated fan→funnel for landscape mapping, `/review` independent evaluation, `/string-diagram` the palgebra formalism, and `/handoff` continuity across agent sessions.

## Core insights

1. **LLMs are storytelling machines.** Everything they produce - mathematical proofs, legal analysis, code, decision trees - are narrative constructs, not mechanistic solutions.

2. **Observation changes state.** Every AI response is a control signal that modifies your cognitive state. You cannot ask a question without being changed by the answer.

3. **Gaps produce bridges that change situations.** The act of articulating a problem transforms the problem. Sense-making isn't discovery - it's production.

4. **Repetition produces difference.** Asking "the same" question multiple times isn't failure - it's exploration of latent space, mapping the territory of possible interpretations.

5. **The analyst is an editor.** Your role isn't truth-seeker but curator of which stories get "published to reality."

## Why "Cyberneutics"?

Cyberneutics is a neologism derived from

> Cyber (κυβερνήτης, the steersman) - governance, feedback, control  
> Neutics - evoking both hermeneutics (interpretation of texts) and neural (the substrate you're actually working with)

It captures something that "narrative computing" doesn't quite get at: that you're not just computing on narratives but doing something closer to steering through interpretation - the cybernetic loop applied to meaning-making with neural systems.
There's also a nice echo of heuristics in there, which fits the System 1 / fast-pass dimension of the work.

Cyberneutics builds upon the runtime environment of **[MOOLLM](https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm)** (Don Hopkins) and aligns with the philosophy of **[Narrative Engineering](https://alexbo.land/essays/narrative_engineering_2023.html)** (Alex Boland). Think of it as: **MOOLLM is the platform, Cyberneutics is the practice.**

## Status

This is early-stage documentation of an emerging methodology. The techniques have been refined through iterative practice and have reached stable behavioral equilibrium; the theoretical framework is being formalized. As of Feb 2026, uptake signals include two external forks (one with merged Condorcet/comparison work), MOOLLM integration of the committee mechanism, and two repository stars (as of 2026-02-23). Current state and a brief trajectory are in [Uptake and usage](meta/uptake-and-usage.md); a dated event log is in [usage-and-uptake-chronology](meta/usage-and-uptake-chronology.md).

**Run and test:** For how to run the methodology (skills in chat, string-diagram script) and how to test the repo (smoke test, structure checks), see the [repository review and run guide](meta/repository-review-and-run-guide.md). For recent session context and maintainer hand-off, see the latest handoff in [agent/](agent/).

**Evidence base**: The adversarial committee technique has empirical support from research on multi-agent reasoning — see [Societies of Thought](essays/societies-of-thought-synthesis.md) for a synthesis of findings from Google, UChicago, and the Santa Fe Institute. Comparison runs ([deliberative vs. CJT-style independent vote](artifacts/comparison-protocol-deliberative-vs-cjt.md)) provide initial evidence that deliberation with Robert's Rules produces materially different outcomes than independent aggregation; on a value-laden question the two pipelines gave opposite verdicts (see [comparison records](agent/comparisons/)). The theoretical foundations draw on sense-making methodology (Dervin), second-order cybernetics (von Foerster, Bateson), and process philosophy (Deleuze). The relationship to Condorcet's jury theorem is [explicitly documented](artifacts/condorcet-jury-theorem-and-committee.md): we use CJT as a motivating analogy but do not satisfy its conditions, by design. What remains to be validated is the specific combination of techniques and their calibration across problem domains.
